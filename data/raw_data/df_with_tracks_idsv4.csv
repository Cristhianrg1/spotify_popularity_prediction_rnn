The Combat.

I.

Fair as the earliest beam of eastern light,
When first, by the bewildered pilgrim spied,
It smiles upon the dreary brow of night
And silvers o'er the torrent's foaming tide
And lights the fearful path on mountain-side,--
Fair as that beam, although the fairest far,
Giving to horror grace, to danger pride,
Shine martial Faith, and Courtesy's bright star
Through all the wreckful storms that cloud the brow of War.


II.

That early beam, so fair and sheen,
Was twinkling through the hazel screen
When, rousing at its glimmer red,
The warriors left their lowly bed,
Looked out upon the dappled sky,
Muttered their soldier matins try,
And then awaked their fire, to steal,
As short and rude, their soldier meal.
That o'er, the Gael around him threw
His graceful plaid of varied hue,
And, true to promise, led the way,
By thicket green and mountain gray.
A wildering path!--they winded now
Along the precipice's brow,
Commanding the rich scenes beneath,
The windings of the Forth and Teith,
And all the vales between that lie.
Till Stirling's turrets melt in sky;
Then, sunk in copse, their farthest glance
Gained not the length of horseman's lance.
'Twas oft so steep, the foot was as fain
Assistance from the hand to gain;
So tangled oft that, bursting through,
Each hawthorn shed her showers of dew,--
That diamond dew, so pure and clear,
It rivals all but Beauty's tear!

III.

At length they came where, stern and steep,
The hill sinks down upon the deep.
Here Vennachar in silver flows,
There, ridge on ridge, Benledi rose;
Ever the hollow path twined on,
Beneath steep hank and threatening stone;
A hundred men might hold the post
With hardihood against a host.
The rugged mountain's scanty cloak
Was dwarfish shrubs of birch and oak
With shingles bare, and cliffs between
And patches bright of bracken green,
And heather black, that waved so high,
It held the copse in rivalry.
But where the lake slept deep and still
Dank osiers fringed the swamp and hill;
And oft both path and hill were torn
Where wintry torrent down had borne
And heaped upon the cumbered land
Its wreck of gravel, rocks, and sand.
So toilsome was the road to trace
The guide, abating of his pace,
Led slowly through the pass's jaws
And asked Fitz-James by what strange cause
He sought these wilds, traversed by few
Without a pass from Roderick Dhu.

IV.

'Brave Gael, my pass, in danger tried
Hangs in my belt and by my side
Yet, sooth to tell,' the Saxon said,
'I dreamt not now to claim its aid.
When here, but three days since,
I came Bewildered in pursuit of game,
All seemed as peaceful and as still
As the mist slumbering on yon hill;
Thy dangerous Chief was then afar,
Nor soon expected back from war.
Thus said, at least, my mountain-guide,
Though deep perchance the villain lied.'
'Yet why a second venture try?'
'A warrior thou, and ask me why!--
Moves our free course by such fixed cause
As gives the poor mechanic laws?
Enough, I sought to drive away
The lazy hours of peaceful day;
Slight cause will then suffice to guide
A Knight's free footsteps far and wide,--
A falcon flown, a greyhound strayed,
The merry glance of mountain maid;
Or, if a path be dangerous known,
The danger's self is lure alone.'

V.

'Thy secret keep, I urge thee not;--
Yet, ere again ye sought this spot,
Say, heard ye naught of Lowland war,
Against Clan-Alpine, raised by Mar?'
'No, by my word;--of bands prepared
To guard King James's sports I heard;
Nor doubt I aught, but, when they hear
This muster of the mountaineer,
Their pennons will abroad be flung,
Which else in Doune had peaceful hung.'
'Free be they flung! for we were loath
Their silken folds should feast the moth.
Free be they flung!--as free shall wave
Clan-Alpine's pine in banner brave.
But, stranger, peaceful since you came,
Bewildered in the mountain-game,
Whence the bold boast by which you show
Vich-Alpine's vowed and mortal foe?'
'Warrior, but yester-morn I knew
Naught of thy Chieftain, Roderick Dhu,
Save as an outlawed desperate man,
The chief of a rebellious clan,
Who, in the Regent's court and sight,
With ruffian dagger stabbed a knight;
Yet this alone might from his part
Sever each true and loyal heart.'


VI.

Wrathful at such arraignment foul,
Dark lowered the clansman's sable scowl.
A space he paused, then sternly said,
'And heardst thou why he drew his blade?
Heardst thou that shameful word and blow
Brought Roderick's vengeance on his foe?
What recked the Chieftain if he stood
On Highland heath or Holy-Rood?
He rights such wrong where it is given,
If it were in the court of heaven.'
'Still was it outrage;--yet, 'tis true,
Not then claimed sovereignty his due;
While Albany with feeble hand
Held borrowed truncheon of command,
The young King, mewed in Stirling tower,
Was stranger to respect and power.
But then, thy Chieftain's robber life!--
Winning mean prey by causeless strife,
Wrenching from ruined Lowland swain
His herds and harvest reared in vain,--
Methinks a soul like thine should scorn
The spoils from such foul foray borne.'


VII.

The Gael beheld him grim the while,
And answered with disdainful smile:
'Saxon, from yonder mountain high,
I marked thee send delighted eye
Far to the south and east, where lay,
Extended in succession gay,
Deep waving fields and pastures green,
With gentle slopes and groves between:--
These fertile plains, that softened vale,
Were once the birthright of the Gael;
The stranger came with iron hand,
And from our fathers reft the land.
Where dwell we now?  See, rudely swell
Crag over crag, and fell o'er fell.
Ask we this savage hill we tread
For fattened steer or household bread,
Ask we for flocks these shingles dry,
And well the mountain might reply,--
""To you, as to your sires of yore,
Belong the target and claymore!
I give you shelter in my breast,
Your own good blades must win the rest.""
Pent in this fortress of the North,
Think'st thou we will not sally forth,
To spoil the spoiler as we may,
And from the robber rend the prey?
Ay, by my soul!--While on yon plain
The Saxon rears one shock of grain,
While of ten thousand herds there strays
But one along yon river's maze,--
The Gael, of plain and river heir,
Shall with strong hand redeem his share.
Where live the mountain Chiefs who hold
That plundering Lowland field and fold
Is aught but retribution true?
Seek other cause 'gainst Roderick Dhu.'


VIII.

Answered Fitz-James: 'And, if I sought,
Think'st thou no other could be brought?
What deem ye of my path waylaid?
My life given o'er to ambuscade?'
'As of a meed to rashness due:
Hadst thou sent warning fair and true,--
I seek my hound or falcon strayed,
I seek, good faith, a Highland maid,--
Free hadst thou been to come and go;
But secret path marks secret foe.
Nor yet for this, even as a spy,
Hadst thou, unheard, been doomed to die,
Save to fulfil an augury.'
'Well, let it pass; nor will I now
Fresh cause of enmity avow
To chafe thy mood and cloud thy brow.
Enough, I am by promise tied
To match me with this man of pride:
Twice have I sought Clan-Alpine's glen
In peace; but when I come again,
I come with banner, brand, and bow,
As leader seeks his mortal foe.
For love-lore swain in lady's bower
Ne'er panted for the appointed hour
As I, until before me stand
This rebel Chieftain and his band!'


IX.

'Have then thy wish!'--He whistled shrill
And he was answered from the hill;
Wild as the scream of the curlew,
From crag to crag the signal flew.
Instant, through copse and heath, arose
Bonnets and spears and bended bows
On right, on left, above, below,
Sprung up at once the lurking foe;
From shingles gray their lances start,
The bracken bush sends forth the dart,
The rushes and the willow-wand
Are bristling into axe and brand,
And every tuft of broom gives life
'To plaided warrior armed for strife.
That whistle garrisoned the glen
At once with full five hundred men,
As if the yawning hill to heaven
A subterranean host had given.
Watching their leader's beck and will,
All silent there they stood and still.
Like the loose crags whose threatening mass
Lay tottering o'er the hollow pass,
As if an infant's touch could urge
Their headlong passage down the verge,
With step and weapon forward flung,
Upon the mountain-side they hung.
The Mountaineer cast glance of pride
Along Benledi's living side,
Then fixed his eye and sable brow
Full on Fitz-James: 'How say'st thou now?
These are Clan-Alpine's warriors true;
And, Saxon,--I am Roderick Dhu!'


X.

Fitz-James was brave:--though to his heart
The life-blood thrilled with sudden start,
He manned himself with dauntless air,
Returned the Chief his haughty stare,
His back against a rock he bore,
And firmly placed his foot before:--
'Come one, come all! this rock shall fly
From its firm base as soon as I.'
Sir Roderick marked,--and in his eyes
Respect was mingled with surprise,
And the stern joy which warriors feel
In foeman worthy of their steel.
Short space he stood--then waved his hand:
Down sunk the disappearing band;
Each warrior vanished where he stood,
In broom or bracken, heath or wood;
Sunk brand and spear and bended bow,
In osiers pale and copses low;
It seemed as if their mother Earth
Had swallowed up her warlike birth.
The wind's last breath had tossed in air
Pennon and plaid and plumage fair,--
The next but swept a lone hill-side
Where heath and fern were waving wide:
The sun's last glance was glinted back
From spear and glaive, from targe and jack,--
The next, all unreflected, shone
On bracken green and cold gray stone.


XI.

Fitz-James looked round,--yet scarce believed
The witness that his sight received;
Such apparition well might seem
Delusion of a dreadful dream.
Sir Roderick in suspense he eyed,
And to his look the Chief replied:
'Fear naught--nay, that I need not say
But--doubt not aught from mine array.
Thou art my guest;--I pledged my word
As far as Coilantogle ford:
Nor would I call a clansman's brand
For aid against one valiant hand,
Though on our strife lay every vale
Rent by the Saxon from the Gael.
So move we on;--I only meant
To show the reed on which you leant,
Deeming this path you might pursue
Without a pass from Roderick Dhu.'
They moved;--I said Fitz-James was brave
As ever knight that belted glaive,
Yet dare not say that now his blood
Kept on its wont and tempered flood,
As, following Roderick's stride, he drew
That seeming lonesome pathway through,
Which yet by fearful proof was rife
With lances, that, to take his life,
Waited but signal from a guide,
So late dishonored and defied.
Ever, by stealth, his eye sought round
The vanished guardians of the ground,
And stir'd from copse and heather deep
Fancy saw spear and broadsword peep,
And in the plover's shrilly strain
The signal whistle heard again.
Nor breathed he free till far behind
The pass was left; for then they wind
Along a wide and level green,
Where neither tree nor tuft was seen,
Nor rush nor bush of broom was near,
To hide a bonnet or a spear.


XII.

The Chief in silence strode before,
And reached that torrent's sounding shore,
Which, daughter of three mighty lakes,
From Vennachar in silver breaks,
Sweeps through the plain, and ceaseless mines
On Bochastle the mouldering lines,
Where Rome, the Empress of the world,
Of yore her eagle wings unfurled.
And here his course the Chieftain stayed,
Threw down his target and his plaid,
And to the Lowland warrior said:
'Bold Saxon! to his promise just,
Vich-Alpine has discharged his trust.
This murderous Chief, this ruthless man,
This head of a rebellious clan,
Hath led thee safe, through watch and ward,
Far past Clan-Alpine's outmost guard.
Now, man to man, and steel to steel,
A Chieftain's vengeance thou shalt feel.
See, here all vantageless I stand,
Armed like thyself with single brand;
For this is Coilantogle ford,
And thou must keep thee with thy sword.'


XIII.

The Saxon paused: 'I ne'er delayed,
When foeman bade me draw my blade;
Nay more, brave Chief, I vowed thy death;
Yet sure thy fair and generous faith,
And my deep debt for life preserved,
A better meed have well deserved:
Can naught but blood our feud atone?
Are there no means?'--' No, stranger, none!
And hear,--to fire thy flagging zeal,--
The Saxon cause rests on thy steel;
For thus spoke Fate by prophet bred
Between the living and the dead:""
Who spills the foremost foeman's life,
His party conquers in the strife.""'
'Then, by my word,' the Saxon said,
""The riddle is already read.
Seek yonder brake beneath the cliff,--
There lies Red Murdoch, stark and stiff.
Thus Fate hath solved her prophecy;
Then yield to Fate, and not to me.
To James at Stirling let us go,
When, if thou wilt be still his foe,
Or if the King shall not agree
To grant thee grace and favor free,
I plight mine honor, oath, and word
That, to thy native strengths restored,
With each advantage shalt thou stand
That aids thee now to guard thy land.'


XIV.

Dark lightning flashed from Roderick's eye:
'Soars thy presumption, then, so high,
Because a wretched kern ye slew,
Homage to name to Roderick Dhu?
He yields not, he, to man nor Fate!
Thou add'st but fuel to my hate;--
My clansman's blood demands revenge.
Not yet prepared?--By heaven, I change
My thought, and hold thy valor light
As that of some vain carpet knight,
Who ill deserved my courteous care,
And whose best boast is but to wear
A braid of his fair lady's hair.' 'I thank thee,
Roderick, for the word!
It nerves my heart, it steels my sword;
For I have sworn this braid to stain
In the best blood that warms thy vein.
Now, truce, farewell! and, rush, begone!--
Yet think not that by thee alone,
Proud Chief! can courtesy be shown;
Though not from copse, or heath, or cairn,
Start at my whistle clansmen stern,
Of this small horn one feeble blast
Would fearful odds against thee cast.
But fear not -- doubt not--which thou wilt--
We try this quarrel hilt to hilt.'
Then each at once his falchion drew,
Each on the ground his scabbard threw
Each looked to sun and stream and plain
As what they ne'er might see again;
Then foot and point and eye opposed,
In dubious strife they darkly closed.


XV.

Ill fared it then with Roderick Dhu,
That on the field his targe he threw,
Whose brazen studs and tough bull-hide
Had death so often dashed aside;
For, trained abroad his arms to wield
Fitz-James's blade was sword and shield.
He practised every pass and ward,
To thrust, to strike, to feint, to guard;
While less expert, though stronger far,
The Gael maintained unequal war.
Three times in closing strife they stood
And thrice the Saxon blade drank blood;
No stinted draught, no scanty tide,
The gushing flood the tartars dyed.
Fierce Roderick felt the fatal drain,
And showered his blows like wintry rain;
And, as firm rock or castle-roof
Against the winter shower is proof,
The foe, invulnerable still,
Foiled his wild rage by steady skill;
Till, at advantage ta'en, his brand
Forced Roderick's weapon from his hand,
And backward borne upon the lea,
Brought the proud Chieftain to his knee.


XVI.

Now yield thee, or by Him who made
The world, thy heart's blood dyes my blade!;
'Thy threats, thy mercy, I defy!
Let recreant yield, who fears to die.'
Like adder darting from his coil,
Like wolf that dashes through the toil,
Like mountain-cat who guards her young,
Full at Fitz-James's throat he sprung;
Received, but recked not of a wound,
And locked his arms his foeman round.
Now, gallant Saxon, hold thine own!
No maiden's hand is round thee thrown!
That desperate grasp thy frame might feel
Through bars of brass and triple steel!
They tug, they strain! down, down they go,
The Gael above, Fitz-James below.
The Chieftain's gripe his throat compressed,
His knee was planted on his breast;
His clotted locks he backward threw,
Across his brow his hand he drew,
From blood and mist to clear his sight,
Then gleamed aloft his dagger bright!
But hate and fury ill supplied
The stream of life's exhausted tide,
And all too late the advantage came,
To turn the odds of deadly game;
For, while the dagger gleamed on high,
Reeled soul and sense, reeled brain and eye.
Down came the blow! but in the heath
The erring blade found bloodless sheath.
The struggling foe may now unclasp
The fainting Chief's relaxing grasp;
Unwounded from the dreadful close,
But breathless all, Fitz-James arose.


XVII.

He faltered thanks to Heaven for life,
Redeemed, unhoped, from desperate strife;
Next on his foe his look he cast,
Whose every gasp appeared his last
In Roderick's gore he dipped the braid,--
'Poor Blanche! thy wrongs are dearly paid;
Yet with thy foe must die, or live,
The praise that faith and valor give.'
With that he blew a bugle note,
Undid the collar from his throat,
Unbonneted, and by the wave
Sat down his brow and hands to rave.
Then faint afar are heard the feet
Of rushing steeds in gallop fleet;
The sounds increase, and now are seen
Four mounted squires in Lincoln green;
Two who bear lance, and two who lead
By loosened rein a saddled steed;
Each onward held his headlong course,
And by Fitz-James reined up his horse,--
With wonder viewed the bloody spot,--
'Exclaim not, gallants ' question not.--
You, Herbert and Luffness, alight
And bind the wounds of yonder knight;
Let the gray palfrey bear his weight,
We destined for a fairer freight,
And bring him on to Stirling straight;
I will before at better speed,
To seek fresh horse and fitting weed.
The sun rides high;--I must be boune
To see the archer-game at noon;
But lightly Bayard clears the lea.--
De Vaux and Herries. follow me.


XVIII.

'Stand, Bayard, stand!'--the steed obeyed,
With arching neck and bended head,
And glancing eye and quivering ear,
As if he loved his lord to hear.
No foot Fitz-James in stirrup stayed,
No grasp upon the saddle laid,
But wreathed his left hand in the mane,
And lightly bounded from the plain,
Turned on the horse his armed heel,
And stirred his courage with the steel.
Bounded the fiery steed in air,
The rider sat erect and fair,
Then like a bolt from steel crossbow
Forth launched, along the plain they go.
They dashed that rapid torrent through,
And up Carhonie's hill they flew;
Still at the gallop pricked the Knight,
His merrymen followed as they might.
Along thy banks, swift Teith! they ride,
And in the race they mock thy tide;
Torry and Lendrick now are past,
And Deanstown lies behind them cast;
They rise, the bannered towers of Doune,
They sink in distant woodland soon;
Blair-Drummond sees the hoofs strike fire,
They sweep like breeze through Ochtertyre;
They mark just glance and disappear
The lofty brow of ancient Kier;
They bathe their coursers' sweltering sides
Dark Forth! amid thy sluggish tides,
And on the opposing shore take ground
With plash, with scramble, and with bound.
Right-hand they leave thy cliffs, Craig-Forth!
And soon the bulwark of the North,
Gray Stirling, with her towers and town,
Upon their fleet career looked clown.


XIX.

As up the flinty path they strained,
Sudden his steed the leader reined;
A signal to his squire he flung,
Who instant to his stirrup sprung:--
'Seest thou, De Vaux, yon woodsman gray,
Who townward holds the rocky way,
Of stature tall and poor array?
Mark'st thou the firm, yet active stride,
With which he scales the mountain-side?
Know'st thou from whence he comes, or whom?'
'No, by my word;--a burly groom
He seems, who in the field or chase
A baron's train would nobly grace--'
'Out, out, De Vaux! can fear supply,
And jealousy, no sharper eye?
Afar, ere to the hill he drew,
That stately form and step I knew;
Like form in Scotland is not seen,
Treads not such step on Scottish green.
'Tis James of Douglas, by Saint Serle!
The uncle of the banished Earl.
Away, away, to court, to show
The near approach of dreaded foe:
The King must stand upon his guard;
Douglas and he must meet prepared.'
Then right-hand wheeled their steeds, and straight
They won the Castle's postern gate.

The Douglas, who had bent his way
From Cambus-kenneth's abbey gray,
Now, as he climbed the rocky shelf,
Held sad communion with himself:--
'Yes! all is true my fears could frame;
A prisoner lies the noble Graeme,
And fiery Roderick soon will feel
The vengeance of the royal steel.
I, only I, can ward their fate,--
God grant the ransom come not late!
The Abbess hath her promise given,
My child shall be the bride of Heaven;--
Be pardoned one repining tear!
For He who gave her knows how dear,
How excellent!--but that is by,
And now my business is--to die.--
Ye towers! within whose circuit dread
A Douglas by his sovereign bled;
And thou, O sad and fatal mound!
That oft hast heard the death-axe sound.
As on the noblest of the land
Fell the stern headsmen's bloody hand,--
The dungeon, block, and nameless tomb
Prepare--for Douglas seeks his doom!
But hark! what blithe and jolly peal
Makes the Franciscan steeple reel?
And see! upon the crowded street,
In motley groups what masquers meet!
Banner and pageant, pipe and drum,
And merry morrice-dancers come.
I guess, by all this quaint array,
The burghers hold their sports to-day.
James will be there; he loves such show,
Where the good yeoman bends his bow,
And the tough wrestler foils his foe,
As well as where, in proud career,
The high-born filter shivers spear.
I'll follow to the Castle-park,
And play my prize;--King James shall mark
If age has tamed these sinews stark,
Whose force so oft in happier days
His boyish wonder loved to praise.'


XXI.

The Castle gates were open flung,
The quivering drawbridge rocked and rung,
And echoed loud the flinty street
Beneath the coursers' clattering feet,
As slowly down the steep descent
Fair Scotland's King and nobles went,
While all along the crowded way
Was jubilee and loud huzza.
And ever James was bending low
To his white jennet's saddle-bow,
Doffing his cap to city dame,
Who smiled and blushed for pride and shame.
And well the simperer might be vain,--
He chose the fairest of the train.
Gravely he greets each city sire,
Commends each pageant's quaint attire,
Gives to the dancers thanks aloud,
And smiles and nods upon the crowd,
Who rend the heavens with their acclaims,--
'Long live the Commons' King, King James!'
Behind the King thronged peer and knight,
And noble dame and damsel bright,
Whose fiery steeds ill brooked the stay
Of the steep street and crowded way.
But in the train you might discern
Dark lowering brow and visage stern;
There nobles mourned their pride restrained,
And the mean burgher's joys disdained;
And chiefs, who, hostage for the* clan,
Were each from home a banished man,
There thought upon their own gray tower,
Their waving woods, their feudal power,
And deemed themselves a shameful part
Of pageant which they cursed in heart.


XXII.

Now, in the Castle-park, drew out
Their checkered bands the joyous rout.
There morricers, with bell at heel
And blade in hand, their mazes wheel;
But chief, beside the butts, there stand
Bold Robin Hood and all his band,--
Friar Tuck with quarterstaff and cowl,
Old Scathelocke with his surly scowl,
Maid Marian, fair as ivory bone,
Scarlet, and Mutch, and Little John;
Their bugles challenge all that will,
In archery to prove their skill.
The Douglas bent a bow of might,--
His first shaft centred in the white,
And when in turn he shot again,
His second split the first in twain.
From the King's hand must Douglas take
A silver dart, the archers' stake;
Fondly he watched, with watery eye,
Some answering glance of sympathy,--
No kind emotion made reply!
Indifferent as to archer wight,
The monarch gave the arrow bright.


XXIII.

Now, clear the ring! for, hand to hand,
The manly wrestlers take their stand.
Two o'er the rest superior rose,
And proud demanded mightier foes,--
Nor called in vain, for Douglas came.--
For life is Hugh of Larbert lame;
Scarce better John of Alloa's fare,
Whom senseless home his comrades bare.
Prize of the wrestling match, the King
To Douglas gave a golden ring,
While coldly glanced his eye of blue,
As frozen drop of wintry dew.
Douglas would speak, but in his breast
His struggling soul his words suppressed;
Indignant then he turned him where
Their arms the brawny yeomen bare,
To hurl the massive bar in air.
When each his utmost strength had shown,
The Douglas rent an earth-fast stone
From its deep bed, then heaved it high,
And sent the fragment through the sky
A rood beyond the farthest mark;
And still in Stirling's royal park,
The gray-haired sires, who know the past,
To strangers point the Douglas cast,
And moralize on the decay
Of Scottish strength in modern day.


XXIV.

The vale with loud applauses rang,
The Ladies' Rock sent back the clang.
The King, with look unmoved, bestowed
A purse well filled with pieces broad.
Indignant smiled the Douglas proud,
And threw the gold among the crowd,
Who now with anxious wonder scan,
And sharper glance, the dark gray man;
Till whispers rose among the throng,
That heart so free, and hand so strong,
Must to the Douglas blood belong.
The old men marked and shook the head,
To see his hair with silver spread,
And winked aside, and told each son
Of feats upon the English done,
Ere Douglas of the stalwart hand
Was exiled from his native land.
The women praised his stately form,
Though wrecked by many a winter's storm;
The youth with awe and wonder saw
His strength surpassing Nature's law.
Thus judged, as is their wont, the crowd
Till murmurs rose to clamours loud.
But not a glance from that proud ring
Of peers who circled round the King
With Douglas held communion kind,
Or called the banished man to mind;
No, not from those who at the chase
Once held his side the honoured place,
Begirt his board, and in the field
Found safety underneath his shield;
For he whom royal eyes disown,
When was his form to courtiers known!


XXV.

The Monarch saw the gambols flag
And bade let loose a gallant stag,
Whose pride, the holiday to crown,
Two favorite greyhounds should pull down,
That venison free and Bourdeaux wine
Might serve the archery to dine.
But Lufra,--whom from Douglas' side
Nor bribe nor threat could e'er divide,
The fleetest hound in all the North,--
Brave Lufra saw, and darted forth.
She left the royal hounds midway,
And dashing on the antlered prey,
Sunk her sharp muzzle in his flank,
And deep the flowing life-blood drank.
The King's stout huntsman saw the sport
By strange intruder broken short,
Came up, and with his leash unbound
In anger struck the noble hound.
The Douglas had endured, that morn,
The King's cold look, the nobles' scorn,
And last, and worst to spirit proud,
Had borne the pity of the crowd;
But Lufra had been fondly bred,
To share his board, to watch his bed,
And oft would Ellen Lufra's neck
In maiden glee with garlands deck;
They were such playmates that with name
Of Lufra Ellen's image came.
His stifled wrath is brimming high,
In darkened brow and flashing eye;
As waves before the bark divide,
The crowd gave way before his stride;
Needs but a buffet and no more,
The groom lies senseless in his gore.
Such blow no other hand could deal,
Though gauntleted in glove of steel.


XXVI.

Then clamored loud the royal train,
And brandished swords and staves amain,
But stern the Baron's warning:
'Back! Back, on your lives, ye menial pack!
Beware the Douglas.--Yes! behold,
King James! The Douglas, doomed of old,
And vainly sought for near and far,
A victim to atone the war,
A willing victim, now attends,
Nor craves thy grace but for his friends.--'
'Thus is my clemency repaid?
Presumptuous Lord!' the Monarch said:
'Of thy misproud ambitious clan,
Thou, James of Bothwell, wert the man,
The only man, in whom a foe
My woman-mercy would not know;
But shall a Monarch's presence brook
Injurious blow and haughty look?--
What ho! the Captain of our Guard!
Give the offender fitting ward.--
Break off the sports!'--for tumult rose,
And yeomen 'gan to bend their bows,
'Break off the sports!' he said and frowned,
'And bid our horsemen clear the ground.'


XXVII.

Then uproar wild and misarray
Marred the fair form of festal day.
The horsemen pricked among the crowd,
Repelled by threats and insult loud;
To earth are borne the old and weak,
The timorous fly, the women shriek;
With flint, with shaft, with staff, with bar,
The hardier urge tumultuous war.
At once round Douglas darkly sweep
The royal spears in circle deep,
And slowly scale the pathway steep,
While on the rear in thunder pour
The rabble with disordered roar
With grief the noble Douglas saw
The Commons rise against the law,
And to the leading soldier said:
'Sir John of Hyndford, 'twas my blade
That knighthood on thy shoulder laid;
For that good deed permit me then
A word with these misguided men.--


XXVIII,

'Hear, gentle friends, ere yet for me
Ye break the bands of fealty.
My life, my honour, and my cause,
I tender free to Scotland's laws.
Are these so weak as must require
'Fine aid of your misguided ire?
Or if I suffer causeless wrong,
Is then my selfish rage so strong,
My sense of public weal so low,
That, for mean vengeance on a foe,
Those cords of love I should unbind
Which knit my country and my kind?
O no! Believe, in yonder tower
It will not soothe my captive hour,
To know those spears our foes should dread
For me in kindred gore are red:
'To know, in fruitless brawl begun,
For me that mother wails her son,
For me that widow's mate expires,
For me that orphans weep their sires,
That patriots mourn insulted laws,
And curse the Douglas for the cause.
O let your patience ward such ill,
And keep your right to love me still I'


XXIX.

The crowd's wild fury sunk again
In tears, as tempests melt in rain.
With lifted hands and eyes, they prayed
For blessings on his generous head
Who for his country felt alone,
And prized her blood beyond his own.
Old men upon the verge of life
Blessed him who stayed the civil strife;
And mothers held their babes on high,
The self-devoted Chief to spy,
Triumphant over wrongs and ire,
To whom the prattlers owed a sire.
Even the rough soldier's heart was moved;
As if behind some bier beloved,
With trailing arms and drooping head,
The Douglas up the hill he led,
And at the Castle's battled verge,
With sighs resigned his honoured charge.


XXX.

The offended Monarch rode apart,
With bitter thought and swelling heart,
And would not now vouchsafe again
Through Stirling streets to lead his train.
'O Lennox, who would wish to rule
This changeling crowd, this common fool?
Hear'st thou,' he said, 'the loud acclaim
With which they shout the Douglas name?
With like acclaim the vulgar throat
Strained for King James their morning note;
With like acclaim they hailed the day
When first I broke the Douglas sway;
And like acclaim would Douglas greet
If he could hurl me from my seat.
Who o'er the herd would wish to reign,
Fantastic, fickle, fierce, and vain?
Vain as the leaf upon the stream,
And fickle as a changeful dream;
Fantastic as a woman's mood,
And fierce as Frenzy's fevered blood.
Thou many-headed monster-thing,
O who would wish to be thy king?--


XXXI..

'But soft! what messenger of speed
Spurs hitherward his panting steed?
I guess his cognizance afar--
What from our cousin, John of Mar?'
'He prays, my liege, your sports keep bound
Within the safe and guarded ground;
For some foul purpose yet unknown,--
Most sure for evil to the throne,--
The outlawed Chieftain, Roderick Dhu,
Has summoned his rebellious crew;
'Tis said, in James of Bothwell's aid
These loose banditti stand arrayed.
The Earl of Mar this morn from Doune
To break their muster marched, and soon
Your Grace will hear of battle fought;
But earnestly the Earl besought,
Till for such danger he provide,
With scanty train you will not ride.'


XXXII.

'Thou warn'st me I have done amiss,--
I should have earlier looked to this;
I lost it in this bustling day.--
Retrace with speed thy former way;
Spare not for spoiling of thy steed,
The best of mine shall be thy meed.
Say to our faithful Lord of Mar,
We do forbid the intended war;
Roderick this morn in single fight
Was made our prisoner by a knight,
And Douglas hath himself and cause
Submitted to our kingdom's laws.
The tidings of their leaders lost
Will soon dissolve the mountain host,
Nor would we that the vulgar feel,
For their Chief's crimes, avenging steel.
Bear Mar our message, Braco, fly!'
He turned his steed,--'My liege, I hie,
Yet ere I cross this lily lawn
I fear the broadswords will be drawn.'
The turf the flying courser spurned,
And to his towers the King returned.


XXXIII.

Ill with King James's mood that day
Suited gay feast and minstrel lay;
Soon were dismissed the courtly throng,
And soon cut short the festal song.
Nor less upon the saddened town
The evening sunk in sorrow down.
The burghers spoke of civil jar,
Of rumoured feuds and mountain war,
Of Moray, Mar, and Roderick Dhu,
All up in arms;--the Douglas too,
They mourned him pent within the hold,
'Where stout Earl William was of old.'--
And there his word the speaker stayed,
And finger on his lip he laid,
Or pointed to his dagger blade.
But jaded horsemen from the west
At evening to the Castle pressed,
And busy talkers said they bore
Tidings of fight on Katrine's shore;
At noon the deadly fray begun,
And lasted till the set of sun.
Thus giddy rumor shook the town,
Till closed the Night her pennons brown.",2835741,en,en,en,

Here comes the night –
The time of fight –
Eternity –
Of the cruelest deity  -
Fangs of wolves bite -
Murdering daylight -
Light is too blind -
To conquer my darkest mind

I am the dark one –
Who hates the light, who hates the sun –
My odes inspire –
Growling choir

They parasite -
Servants of light –
Lucid vanity -
Denies the dark sanity –
Dread blinds their sight –
Bloody appetite -
Of the moonlight -
Leaving them fulfilled with fright
I am the dark king –
Furiously howling –
Night´s my empire –
Nasty dеsire

Their morbid fear –
Will nеver disappear –
Because the light –
Bigotedly units –
Those who believe –
That darkness brings the grief –
Servants of night –
Invoke my name tonight

Demonic-eyed –
Black-hearted knight –
Demonic-eyed –
Master of night

I am the dark God –
My ways are too odd –
Those who conspire –
Burn in my fire

Demonic-eyed –
Black-hearted knight –
Demonic-eyed –

Up from the Wasteland,rock,Kerry Livgren,1985,270,{},"The traces of tears disappear in the desert
Where hot winds blow
The touch of a conscience is lost in the ice and snow
Ghosts of great cities, ruins of empires their spectres arise
No sign of the living beneath these skies

Minutes are passing, they turn into hours
The hours, they drift into days
O, Redeemer, lift us above this maze

Up from the wasteland, like a dream
Long forgotten reappearing
Up from the wasteland
Now redeemed, from a winter bleak and weary

Dry bones collected, connected by sinews
Stand as an army of men
Filled with the Spirit, they enter this world again

Its glorious light, or grey desolation
The lines of the battle are drawn
Jehovah, the rock that we stand upon
Up from the wasteland
We are drawn, to a glory never ending
Up from the wasteland
By His hand, our iniquity transcending

All our enemies beneath His feet
No height, nor depth, nor life, or death
Can take us away from His love",1403156,en,en,en,6NBS6CybeKmwe3PinnLwxP

Don't have it yet but I'm so thankful for health
I'm ashamed to say I threw away the cards that I've been dealt, I had to do it cuz people shooting but I realized it was pelt
Now I made the move, I can see 'em niggas lurking
Swimming in the deep end cuz I'm still soul searching
They popping Percocet  cuz they mind is still hurtin'
The only thing I pop is soda and it's only when I'm thirsty
It's gets worse when you're fucking cursed, show's over closed the curtain
It's me myself and I but we're not the same person
I'ma show stopper, proper, coulda copped a chopper and start putting holes in these bars and hop in
My future is dead bright as the headlights that the deer got caught in
Dear I dare you to bare the pain of deer or a bear that got caught in a snare or a rear end of a plane

Hook: The youth is taking over, youth is taking over, ahh (x3) youthism, there's still some truth in 'em

On the battlefield surrounded by troops
I stand by mine cuz I'm surrounded by stoops
Stoop down to my level you'll see a wonderful view
And I knew what eve was thinking when she tasted that fruit, gimme the loot
I do it big dog, don't hang around wit small pups wit small paws
I got big balls
I touched a soft spot cuz you don't know how it feels
But I still got too much drive like Jesus go grab the wheel
It's hard to keep my balance like battle rappers in actress heels
Acting like you acting different from acting scripts from a deal
Shut the fuck up, give a fuck how you feel
Passionate, the way I'm rapping it
Took the pen and start scratching it
On a pad of manuscripts, actually
I wasn't too deep into writing songs
I only write my wrongs
It's funny how I got left for writing too long
I'm boxed in but i got a Tyson arm
I took your breath away shit your life is gone
I'm especially a centipede when we're well connected
Stack cheddar stay together, and never disrespect it
Help others if you can help it
Give 'em a sense of direction

Where your eyes be (take a break)
Where your mind be

[Verse 1]
I never listen to my gut
Every girl been the one
Better never made the cut
When better are the best at love
Kill a broken heart with a stab in the back
I attack with my raps, two steps back
Pour judgement onto something beautiful (beautiful is everything you make)
These girls define my life
A chance to see her is impossible
Lonely is me
Think I'll never get a ring
Deep down the wiser conscience knows that thats not how it be, yeah
Focus on a moment of seconds of emotion
But know in the pit of my stomach
There's so much more to life than a girlfriend
It all sounded so perfect

Is this the love that I am founded in?
Is it, is it, is it?
And I am lying here
If happiness was love then I'd be lying
What about God?
Well maybe so

[Interlude 1]
I dream so much
Every love I ever had came to visit
Speaking words I said to them
Hearing it back is different
I'm starting to pick up on ideas that are different
The women the replacement
God is what I've been missing

[Verse 2]
Let that sink in
Soul keeps bleeding
Living on a thing unholy
Rolling wet paper never appealed to me
I'll find a different escape
My words need Jesus Christ
The Christ needs my word
To come into my life
I recommend love but only up above
It's all you need for now, later on she will come
Dance on the drums, face on the sun
Trying to find the one
You've been kidnapped by these devils on these dark nights
Thunder made the road black
Rain made the window drop
Disregard what's around you and focus on the backdrop
The bigger picture

Is this the love that I am founded in?
Is it, is it, is it?
And I am lying here
If happiness was love then I'd be lying
What about God?
Well maybe so

[Interlude 2]
Flew back from vacation
Staring at the wing
Had to shut down service
You talked my way through when I got back
Last moments of happiness before my heart felt a draft
Kept me busy when I was hurting
But what you didn't give me was a spiritual guidance
Haven't been with me since birth
And felt my life as it moved
Compared to Him you have no worth
Thank you for showing me a lesson learned
Excuse me as I write these sixteen tracks
This is a healing process
A custom-made way to get back

[Verse 3]
He will listen to my tracks
He will give me feedback
Every time I pray, He'll reply back
He will keep tabs
He will find the one for me
And when the time feels right
I will live, I will love and treat her right

Voices keep on playing in my sleep every night
I wanna open my window and know what it's like
To feel the world come alive
To feel the world come alive
When it's time, when it's time
To see this cold, cold, cold, cold
World turn bright
Cold, bitter, cold bitter
World finally shine
It's getting old, getting old

But then life derailed
And i crashed
Headibg nowhere
I stared into myself
Couldn't find no help
Depression
The pain that i dealt with
Supressed wasting health huh
Another spliff

Paper filters and grinders
Never felt anything like this
Calm before a storm
People told me that i should try
Demons ive tried to hide


Days went by
Where was i
Why did i keep so quiet bout the part of me that wanted to die


Learned to get under your skin
Hit you where it hurts you scream
And the pills
Man that was for real
Surreal what i felt
The joy that i ain't have
People i did not have around
The music the trance
Something to get you aroused

Its late at night
Get me a fix
Subbing addictions is this what it is

I write about cities that light up at night
And tortures minds on the reflex and at sight
6 months on melancholy hill kill the real
Can i come back to who i was the old life before i tried to escape what i feel
Man that is fucked up
Even worse are the ones that fell and never got up


Paper filters and grinders
Never felt anything like this
I feel so  good  even though
It rots me from inside
Demons ive tried to hide
Paper filters and grinders
Dont fall for it you can not just climb back
Addicted to destructive manners
Meeting your worst self is real hard to manage

My future is odd
Sweating it cold
Nights i dont remember
All the truths being told

True to the different i was
But what was the difference if i was just stuck
Or worse than these kids
Needing the needle just to find their peace
Afflicted i fell into this
Of not fitting in fitting end to that fix
Of weed goddamn trap in the trap what it is",4154137,en,en,en,

14. Storia Senti
Storia senti
Mi nate che hai sentito
Non nascondere, il tempo arrivato loso
L’storia mente
Pavorito, senza luce a morto
Sta n’quel mentre, ami lado, sembra vido
Manacia la vita, dove io andaro

15. Infinite Supply
The stars in the sky were lonely tonight
And so we lit a fire in solidarity
The rain it falls the wind will call
All things that bring prosperity
Take care, take heed, take everything you need
This always will be your sanctuary
Hey it’s me, I’m looking but I don’t see
Please just explain, what am I missing?
You know I try, I keep looking, I don’t know why
All I need is right before my eyes
Oh the size
I believe it now, it’s immense and wild
All this time, lost in the scale of my tiny mind
Small and alone, blind and confined
If I could see the night
Miles out in space the chemicals ignite
Everything moves, expands and collides
But I never knew the universe was wide

The stars will feed forever, as decreed
Blow dust and seed ever on their way
I can feel the sky
All of the world covered in life
Breeze through the wind with all it provides
Showering down it’s the infinite supply

16. Dormouse - An End

Just a word that you’re okay

You’re alive and you escaped

You’ve been to London or what used to be
Dormouse, is it really not there?
The taste of sulfur in the acrid air
From a world laid bare

Your body will follow behind

Your praise will lead to unpleasant dreams

The dreams will turn to sorrow

Sorrow will turn to death

And you will turn to marrow

As your bones evaporate, you shall sadly cry

Wishing you had not praised him in the first place or at all

One day your friends shall go looking for you

Finding you have evaporated, they shall leave

Abandoning you to rot
Taking their friendship away

The time will come, when he shall come

To take you away

And you shall never again

Welcome to the circus tell me what you see

I see the fear in the faces
Of the tea drinking chimps on TV
It's time that we swap places
And went back to swinging in trees
I've seen the world about us
And the Disneyland dream's a lie
But we finally abuse so amusing
'Cause we get the last laugh time after time

Heard about the birds heard about the beasts
Welcome to the circus tell me what you see

Fur coats on ugly people
Expensively dressed up to kill
In a sport that's legal
Within the minds of the mentally ill
The skins on the bones are reminders
Of the law of the gun
And the hunting continues and we'll do until we
Decide to undo the damage that's done
Heard about the birds heard about the beasts
Welcome to the circus tell me what you see

If you could talk to the animals, to the animals
Could you justify your reasons
With the animals why the animals
Isn't it enough to eat them
I see a room of sadness
The real version of Frankenstein's dream
There's no human kindness
Hust white coats and scapegoats and guinea pigs dream
So this is evolution
And the animals do what they're told
They make contributions
Then we go and swallow them whole

Know that my picture's been focusing

Watch how I run it

(Stop what you’re doing)

The journey is hard
But that’s what makes it worth
It’s through our struggles that we come to find our true purpose
That’s what keeps me always smiling
Even when I’m feeling worthless
Yeah
I hurt too
I just never let it show on the surface
Cuz I got people look to me for hope at all times
And Even more watch
And preying for my fall and demise
But don’t get bitter get better
It’s hanging on my wall
My dad put it there after my junior year of football
I’ve been growing ever since
Moving silent on the rise
But once this tape drops
Imma really open eyes
Show em
What makes the kind different than all these other guys
It’s the time and the effort
That I put in every line
So when it gets hard
I just look inside
Find my purest voice
Say whatever is inside
Write it all down
Make a hit with holy rhymes
Put it on a holy beat
And get to feeling sanctified
Right
That’s how I ride
Yeah that’s how I ride
Let my soul
Catch the flow
Truth in my lyrics make it fly
S’why
When the OG’s listen
I really don’t have to try
Because real respect real
That’s just how it go right
Learned that from my gramps
Up in Oklahoma
All the respect that man got
He held the fam on his shoulders
Just the simplest form of style
Man it always stuck with me
How just one simple smile
Can be the missing puzzle piece
To bring the fam together
I put a plan together
To withstand the pressure
And become a man of legend
And I will
I swear I will
That’s part of the deal
That I make with myself
When I look in the mirror
Imma be the puzzle piece
The family dream catcher
Live your dreams through me
Because once I make it
Then you on in a second
And that’s my secret blessing
If I wanna give up
I think of you and I’m resurrected
I get up I get up
So I know
That they know
Cal won’t stop
Till we got our own show
I just listen to Mihaly
And I stay in my flow
Cuz I already know
That’s what’s gon get me a throne
I feel it resonate deep in my bones
Keeps on feeding me songs
To help save this generation
Cuz my favorite artist said he can’t save it alone
That’s alright
Now I’m here
Let’s get to saving em all
Saw I was special
When my speech brought me to Chicago
That’s when my mom told me my talent was all god given
So a life without me rapping
Would just be wrong living

Not paying attention

To not feel a love
To not be enough for them but maybe
You need remedies

You need sеdatives

Followed on foot indeed the cliff by the county line
Ran on up the road a piece making up some time
New night like a battery
New night for ye old choke soak
Feel the wind unwind
Like the end of a shredded rope
The Neptune’s net parking lot pets all know
That the sun is sinking down into the big below

Moon shining on the black grass

I got lost sometime found some fruit rotten on the vine
Dumb but still talking looking but still blind
Surprised to see it here I thought I left it all behind
Seems the seeds been planted the entire time
With a big black cloud from the valley coming over the hill
Hand perched on the dark burnt cup so careful that it spills / so special that it spills
Like a thorn in deep
Seeking something so strong that it kills
And the human being and the bird and beast on the window sill

I'm so thankful, I learn a new lesson everyday
I was schemin', runnin' wild, and then I caught a case
I was locked up in a cage, that's when it all came to my brain
Keep your head up, Kodak, get out there, just do your thing
Get your bread up, Kodak, you ain't got no time to play
I was fed up, lost a lot, but never lost my faith
Cause there's reason's, I go through what I'm goin' through today
Had to tell myself, ""Kodak, you don't bubble, you in trouble""
Had to tell myself, ""Fuck my friends, cause all I got is my brothers""
Then I told myself, ""Fuck these hoes, all I need is my mother""
Cause I realize, that I wouldn't be shit without my mama
Please forgive me Lord, know you understand that it's a struggle
Just a lil boy, in these streets, got caught up with the hustle
This for my two brother's, all we got is each other
I would be nothin' without em, that's why I love em
I gotta stay pure, I gotta stay positive
Imma step up to the plate, won't run a way, like my father did
Try to put my nigga on, but he didn't stick to the code
I ain't tryin' that shit no more, I'm just gon' keep my focus on
I gotta keep movin' forward, I can't get caught up in my ways
I been lost out here like pacman, feelin' like I'm in a maze
Steady leanin' off promethazine, I ain't got no medicaid
It's destined I'm gon' see my blessings, gon' be better days
You wasn't worried bout me then, why you worried bout me now?
Thank the Lord for what I got, cause I use to wear Fila
Niggas tryna box me out, been up, but I've been down a lot
Everything is temporary, don't get comfortable in your spot
You could be droppin' your girl at work, he'll be runnin' up in your spot
My niggas locked up, watchin' the clock, I can't wait until he drop
Counting bricks up on the wall, when I talk they drop the wall
You should want me to excel, why you wanna see me fall?
I been coughin' all night, it done really got severe
They say I should get it cured, before it get even worse
So they gave me cough drops, but I'm drinkin' cough syrup

The times when we
Were hurting one another

I look back on that now

And it's good to know

Sometimes like a storm
It was cold and rainy

But we got by

We lost years
Trying to find it

How in the world did we survive?

It almost died
And if we protect our love
There's a chance that we might
Make it last forever

And if we wait too long
There's a chance that we may never know

If love goes passing by

What about starting something new?

Just the two of us, baby
Got an awful lot to do

It don't matter who was wrong
Cause I know that we can make it

Right now we've got to stay strong

At times I know it wasn't easy
But we'll get by

It's much too late
To walk away and say goodbye
And let our love die
And if we protect our love
There's a chance that we might
Make it last forever

The past is dead
The past is gone

Why take a chance that we may never know

Nobel Lecture in Literature 1991: Writing and Being Gordimer,misc,Nadine Gordimer,1991,50,{},"In the beginning was the Word.

The Word was with God, signified God's Word, the word that was Creation. But over the centuries of human culture the word has taken on other meanings, secular as well as religious. To have the word has come to be synonymous with ultimate authority, with prestige, with awesome, sometimes dangerous persuasion, to have Prime Time, a TV talk show, to have the gift of the gab as well as that of speaking in tongues. The word flies through space, it is bounced from satellites, now nearer than it has ever been to the heaven from which it was believed to have come. But its most significant transformation occurred for me and my kind long ago, when it was first scratched on a stone tablet or traced on papyrus, when it materialized from sound to spectacle, from being heard to being read as a series of signs, and then a script; and travelled through time from parchment to Gutenberg. For this is the genesis story of the writer. It is the story that wrote her or him into being.

It was, strangely, a double process, creating at the same time both the writer and the very purpose of the writer as a mutation in the agency of human culture. It was both ontogenesis as the origin and development of an individual being, and the adaptation, in the nature of that individual, specifically to the exploration of ontogenesis, the origin and development of the individual being. For we writers are evolved for that task. Like the prisoners incarcerated with the jaguar in Borges' story, 'The God's Script', who was trying to read, in a ray of light which fell only once a day, the meaning of being from the marking on the creature's pelt, we spend our lives attempting to interpret through the word the readings we take in the societies, the world of which we are part. It is in this sense, this inextricable, ineffable participation, that writing is always and at once an exploration of self and of the world; of individual and collective being.

Being here.

Humans, the only self-regarding animals, blessed or cursed with this torturing higher faculty, have always wanted to know why. And this is not just the great ontological question of why we are here at all, for which religions and philosophies have tried to answer conclusively for various peoples at various times, and science tentatively attempts dazzling bits of explantation we are perhaps going to die out in our millennia, like dinosaurs, without having developed the necessary comprehension to understand as a whole. Since humans became self-regarding they have sought, as well, explanations for the common phenomena of procreation, death, the cycle of seasons, the earth, sea, wind and stars, sun and moon, plenty and disaster. With myth, the writer's ancestors, the oral story-tellers, began to feel out and formulate these mysteries, using the elements of daily life - observable reality - and the faculty of the imagination - the power of projection into the hidden - to make stories.

Roland Barthes asks, 'What is characteristic of myth?' And answers: 'To transform a meaning into form.' Myths are stories that mediate in this way between the known and unknown. Claude Levi-Strauss wittily de-mythologizes myth as a genre between a fairy tale and a detective story. Being here; we don't know who-dun-it. But something satisfying, if not the answer, can be invented. Myth was the mystery plus the fantasy - gods, anthropomorphized animals and birds, chimera, phantasmagorical creatures - that posits out of the imagination some sort of explanation for the mystery. Humans and their fellow creatures were the materiality of the story, but as Nikos Kazantzakis once wrote, 'Art is the representation not of the body but of the forces which created the body.'

There are many proven explanations for natural phenomena now; and there are new questions of being arising out of some of the answers. For this reason, the genre of myth has never been entirely abandoned, although we are inclined to think of it as archaic. If it dwindled to the children's bedtime tale in some societies, in parts of the world protected by forests or deserts from international megaculture it has continued, alive, to offer art as a system of mediation between the individual and being. And it has made a whirling comeback out of Space, an Icarus in the avatar of Batman and his kind, who never fall into the ocean of failure to deal with the gravity forces of life. These new myths, however, do not seek so much to enlighten and provide some sort of answers as to distract, to provide a fantasy escape route for people who no longer want to face even the hazard of answers to the terrors of their existence. (Perhaps it is the positive knowledge that humans now possess the means to destroy their whole planet, the fear that they have in this way themselves become the gods, dreadfully charged with their own continued existence, that has made comic-book and movie myth escapist.) The forces of being remain. They are what the writer, as distinct from the contemporary popular mythmaker, still engage today, as myth in its ancient form attempted to do.

How writers have approached this engagement and continue to experiment with it has been and is, perhaps more than ever, the study of literary scholars. The writer in relation to the nature of perceivable reality and what is beyond - imperceivable reality - is the basis for all these studies, no matter what resulting concepts are labelled, and no matter in what categorized microfiles writers are stowed away for the annals of literary historiography. Reality is constructed out of many elements and entities, seen and unseen, expressed, and left unexpressed for breathing-space in the mind. Yet from what is regarded as old-hat psychological analysis to modernism and post-modernism, structuralism and poststructuralism, all literary studies are aimed at the same end: to pin down to a consistency (and what is consistency if not the principle hidden within the riddle?); to make definitive through methodology the writer's grasp at the forces of being. But life is aleatory in itself; being is constantly pulled and shaped this way and that by circumstances and different levels of consciousness. There is no pure state of being, and it follows that there is no pure text, 'real' text, totally incorporating the aleatory. It surely cannot be reached by any critical methodology, however interesting the attempt. To deconstruct a text is in a way a contradiction, since to deconstruct it is to make another construction out of the pieces, as Roland Barthes does so fascinatingly, and admits to, in his linguistic and semantical dissection of Balzac's story, 'Sarrasine'. So the literary scholars end up being some kind of storyteller, too.

Perhaps there is no other way of reaching some understanding of being than through art? Writers themselves don't analyze what they do; to analyze would be to look down while crossing a canyon on a tightrope. To say this is not to mystify the process of writing but to make an image out of the intense inner concentration the writer must have to cross the chasms of the aleatory and make them the word's own, as an explorer plants a flag. Yeats' inner 'lonely impulse of delight' in the pilot's solitary flight, and his 'terrible beauty' born of mass uprising, both opposed and conjoined; E. M. Forster's modest 'only connect'; Joyce's chosen, wily 'silence, cunning and exile'; more contemporary, Gabriel García Márquez's labyrinth in which power over others, in the person of Simon Bolivar, is led to the thrall of the only unassailable power, death - these are some examples of the writer's endlessly varied ways of approaching the state of being through the word. Any writer of any worth at all hopes to play only a pocket-torch of light - and rarely, through genius, a sudden flambeau - into the bloody yet beautiful labyrinth of human experience, of being.

Anthony Burgess once gave a summary definition of literature as 'the aesthetic exploration of the world'. I would say that writing only begins there, for the exploration of much beyond, which nevertheless only aesthetic means can express.

How does the writer become one, having been given the word? I do not know if my own beginnings have any particular interest. No doubt they have much in common with those of others, have been described too often before as a result of this yearly assembly before which a writer stands. For myself, I have said that nothing factual that I write or say will be as truthful as my fiction. The life, the opinions, are not the work, for it is in the tension between standing apart and being involved that the imagination transforms both. Let me give some minimal account of myself. I am what I suppose would be called a natural writer. I did not make any decision to become one. I did not, at the beginning, expect to earn a living by being read. I wrote as a child out of the joy of apprehending life through my senses - the look and scent and feel of things; and soon out of the emotions that puzzled me or raged within me and which took form, found some enlightenment, solace and delight, shaped in the written word. There is a little Kafka parable that goes like this; 'I have three dogs: Hold-him, Seize-him, and Nevermore. Hold-him and Seize-him are ordinary little Schipperkes and nobody would notice them if they were alone. But there is Nevermore, too. Nevermore is a mongrel Great Dane and has an appearance that centuries of the most careful breeding could never have produced. Nevermore is a gypsy.' In the small South African gold-mining town where I was growing up I was Nevermore the mongrel (although I could scarcely have been described as a Great Dane ...) in whom the accepted characteristics of the townspeople could not be traced. I was the Gypsy, tinkering with words second-hand, mending my own efforts at writing by learning from what I read. For my school was the local library. Proust, Chekhov and Dostoevsky, to name only a few to whom I owe my existence as a writer, were my professors. In that period of my life, yes, I was evidence of the theory that books are made out of other books . . . But I did not remain so for long, nor do I believe any potential writer could.
With adolescence comes the first reaching out to otherness through the drive of sexuality. For most children, from then on the faculty of the imagination, manifest in play, is lost in the focus on day dreams of desire and love, but for those who are going to be artists of one kind or another the first life-crisis after that of birth does something else in addition: the imagination gains range and extends by the subjective flex of new and turbulent emotions. There are new perceptions. The writer begins to be able to enter into other lives. The process of standing apart and being involved has come.

Unknowingly, I had been addressing myself on the subject of being, whether, as in my first stories, there was a child's contemplation of death and murder in the necessity to finish off, with a death blow, a dove mauled by a cat, or whether there was wondering dismay and early consciousness of racism that came of my walk to school, when on the way I passed storekeepers, themselves East European immigrants kept lowest in the ranks of the Anglo-Colonial social scale for whites in the mining town, roughly those whom colonial society ranked lowest of all, discounted as less than human - the black miners who were the stores' customers. Only many years later was I to realize that if I had been a child in that category - black - I might not have become a writer at all, since the library that made this possible for me was not open to any black child. For my formal schooling was sketchy, at best.

To address oneself to others begins a writer's next stage of development. To publish to anyone who would read what I wrote. That was my natural, innocent assumption of what publication meant, and it has not changed , that is what it means to me today, in spite of my awareness that most people refuse to believe that a writer does not have a particular audience in mind; and my other awareness: of the temptations, conscious and unconscious, which lure the writer into keeping a corner of the eye on who will take offense, who will approve what is on the page - a temptation that, like Eurydice's straying glance, will lead the writer back into the Shades of a destroyed talent.

The alternative is not the malediction of the ivory tower, another destroyer of creativity. Borges once said he wrote for his friends and to pass the time. I think this was an irritated flippant response to the crass question - often an accusation - 'For whom do you write?', just as Sartre's admonition that there are times when a writer should cease to write, and act upon being only in another way, was given in the frustration of an unresolved conflict between distress at injustice in the world and the knowledge that what he knew how to do best was write. Both Borges and Sartre, from their totally different extremes of denying literature a social purpose, were certainly perfectly aware that it has its implicit and unalterable social role in exploring the state of being, from which all other roles, personal among friends, public at the protest demonstration, derive. Borges was not writing for his friends, for he published and we all have received the bounty of his work. Sartre did not stop writing, although he stood at the barricades in 1968.

The question of for whom do we write nevertheless plagues the writer, a tin can attached to the tail of every work published. Principally it jangles the inference of tendentiousness as praise or denigration. In this context, Camus dealt with the question best. He said that he liked individuals who take sides more than literatures that do. 'One either serves the whole of man or does not serve him at all. And if man needs bread and justice, and if what has to be done must be done to serve this need, he also needs pure beauty which is the bread of his heart.' So Camus called for 'Courage in and talent in one's work.' And Márquez redefined tender fiction thus: The best way a writer can serve a revolution is to write as well as he can.

I believe that these two statements might be the credo for all of us who write. They do not resolve the conflicts that have come, and will continue to come, to contemporary writers. But they state plainly an honest possibility of doing so, they turn the face of the writer squarely to her and his existence, the reason to be, as a writer, and the reason to be, as a responsible human, acting, like any other, within a social context.

Being here: in a particular time and place. That is the existential position with particular implications for literature. Czeslaw Milosz once wrote the cry: 'What is poetry which does not serve nations or people?' and Brecht wrote of a time when 'to speak of trees is almost a crime'. Many of us have had such despairing thoughts while living and writing through such times, in such places, and Sartre's solution makes no sense in a world where writers were - and still are - censored and forbidden to write, where, far from abandoning the word, lives were and are at risk in smuggling it, on scraps of paper, out of prisons. The state of being whose ontogenesis we explore has overwhelmingly included such experiences. Our approaches, in Nikos Kazantzakis' words, have to 'make the decision which harmonizes with the fearsome rhythm of our time.'

Some of us have seen our books lie for years unread in our own countries, banned, and we have gone on writing. Many writers have been imprisoned. Looking at Africa alone - Soyinka, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Jack Mapanje, in their countries, and in my own country, South Africa, Jeremy Cronin, Mongane Wally Serote, Breyten Breytenbach, Dennis Brutus, Jaki Seroke: all these went to prison for the courage shown in their lives, and have continued to take the right, as poets, to speak of trees. Many of the greats, from Thomas Mann to Chinua Achebe, cast out by political conflict and oppression in different countries, have endured the trauma of exile, from which some never recover as writers, and some do not survive at all. I think of the South Africans, Can Themba, Alex la Guma, Nat Nakasa, Todd Matshikiza. And some writers, over half a century from Joseph Roth to Milan Kundera, have had to publish new works first in the word that is not their own, a foreign language.

Then in 1988 the fearsome rhythm of our time quickened in an unprecedented frenzy to which the writer was summoned to submit the word. In the broad span of modern times since the Enlightenment writers have suffered opprobrium, bannings and even exile for other than political reasons. Flaubert dragged into court for indecency, over Madame Bovary, Strindberg arraigned for blasphemy, over Marrying, Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover banned - there have been many examples of so-called offense against hypocritical bourgeois mores, just as there have been of treason against political dictatorships. But in a period when it would be unheard of for countries such as France, Sweden and Britain to bring such charges against freedom of expression, there has risen a force that takes its appalling authority from something far more widespread than social mores, and far more powerful than the power of any single political regime. The edict of a world religion has sentenced a writer to death.

For more than three years, now, wherever he is hidden, wherever he might go, Salman Rushdie has existed under the Muslim pronouncement upon him of the fatwa. There is no asylum for him anywhere. Every morning when this writer sits down to write, he does not know if he will live through the day; he does not know whether the page will ever be filled. Salman Rushdie happens to be a brilliant writer, and the novel for which he is being pilloried, The Satanic Verses, is an innovative exploration of one of the most intense experiences of being in our era, the individual personality in transition between two cultures brought together in a post-colonial world. All is re-examined through the refraction of the imagination; the meaning of sexual and filial love, the rituals of social acceptance, the meaning of a formative religious faith for individuals removed from its subjectivity by circumstance opposing different systems of belief, religious and secular, in a different context of living. His novel is a true mythology. But although he has done for the postcolonial consciousness in Europe what Gunter Grass did for the post-Nazi one with The Tin Drum and Dog Years, perhaps even has tried to approach what Beckett did for our existential anguish in Waiting For Godot, the level of his achievement should not matter. Even if he were a mediocre writer, his situation is the terrible concern of every fellow writer for, apart from his personal plight, what implications, what new threat against the carrier of the word does it bring? It should be the concern of individuals and above all, of governments and human rights organizations all over the world. With dictatorships apparently vanquished, this murderous new dictate invoking the power of international terrorism in the name of a great and respected religion should and can be dealt with only by democratic governments and the United Nations as an offense against humanity.

I return from the horrific singular threat to those that have been general for writers of this century now in its final, summing-up decade. In repressive regimes anywhere - whether in what was the Soviet bloc, Latin America, Africa, China - most imprisoned writers have been shut away for their activities as citizens striving for liberation against the oppression of the general society to which they belong. Others have been condemned by repressive regimes for serving society by writing as well as they can; for this aesthetic venture of ours becomes subversive when the shameful secrets of our times are explored deeply, with the artist's rebellious integrity to the state of being manifest in life around her or him; then the writer's themes and characters inevitably are formed by the pressures and distortions of that society as the life of the fisherman is determined by the power of the sea.

There is a paradox. In retaining this integrity, the writer sometimes must risk both the state's indictment of treason, and the liberation forces' complaint of lack of blind commitment. As a human being, no writer can stoop to the lie of Manichean 'balance'. The devil always has lead in his shoes, when placed on his side of the scale. Yet, to paraphrase coarsely Márquez's dictum given by him both as a writer and a fighter for justice, the writer must take the right to explore, warts and all, both the enemy and the beloved comrade in arms, since only a try for the truth makes sense of being, only a try for the truth edges towards justice just ahead of Yeats's beast slouching to be born. In literature, from life,

we page through each other's faces
we read each looking eye
... It has taken lives to be able to do so.
These are the words of the South African poet and fighter forjustice and peace in our country, Mongane Serote.
The writer is of service to humankind only insofar as the writer uses the word even against his or her own loyalties, trusts the state of being, as it is revealed, to hold somewhere in its complexity filaments of the cord of truth, able to be bound together, here and there, in art: trusts the state of being to yield somewhere fragmentary phrases of truth, which is the final word of words, never changed by our stumbling efforts to spell it out and write it down, never changed by lies, by semantic sophistry, by the dirtying of the word for the purposes of racism, sexism, prejudice, domination, the glorification of destruction, the curses and the praise-songs.",493172,en,en,en,

Thru the coming darkest storm
All the fear that's sent your way
Thru your eyes you might wash away
When you can
Still your lantern's strong and bright
Even thru the darkest night
All those paper tigers
All their lies they might have sold you
Might be wasted on
One so young that you're old again
She walks out thru the wind and the rain uh-huh

They can't give you all those things
No pot of gold no big brass ring
Stay on the road for the night has come
Perhaps at dawn we will be like one again

All the lies they might have been sold you

One so young that you're old again

Still the shock rips you thru every nerve
In the bell jar nothing can be heard

I would walk with you
I would talk with you
I would do anything that would get you thru
Draw the line for you

I would stand on a bridge and jump off it too

The Gospels on the Resurrection of Jesus Group 7 PRIVATE COURSE PAGE,misc,Holy Bible (NRSV),2015,761,{},"Mark 16:1-81When the sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him. 2And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.3They had been saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?”4When they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled back. 5As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man, dressed in a white robe, sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed. 6But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look, there is the place they laid him. 7But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you.” 8So they went out and fled from the tomb, for terror and amazement had seized them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.Matthew 281After the sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. 2And suddenly there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord, descending from heaven, came and rolled back the stone and sat on it. 3His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. 4For fear of him the guards shook and became like dead men. 5But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified. 6He is not here; for he has been raised, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay. 7Then go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead, and indeed he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him.’ This is my message for you.” 8So they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.9Suddenly Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” And they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him. 10Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.”

11While they were going, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened. 12After the priests had assembled with the elders, they devised a plan to give a large sum of money to the soldiers, 13telling them, “You must say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.’ 14If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.” 15So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story is still told among the Jews to this day.

16Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. 17When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. 18And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”Luke 241But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, taking the spices that they had prepared. 2They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, 3but when they went in, they did not find the body. 4While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them. 5The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen.6Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, 7that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinners, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.” 8Then they remembered his words, 9and returning from the tomb, they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest. 10Now it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles. 11But these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. 12But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; then he went home, amazed at what had happened.

13Now on that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, 14and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. 15While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and went with them, 16but their eyes were kept from recognizing him. 17And he said to them, “What are you discussing with each other while you walk along?” They stood still, looking sad. 18Then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days?” 19He asked them, “What things?” They replied, “The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,20and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him. 21But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things took place. 22Moreover, some women of our group astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning, 23and when they did not find his body there, they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive. 24Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see him.” 25Then he said to them, “Oh, how foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared! 26Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?” 27Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures. 28As they came near the village to which they were going, he walked ahead as if he were going on. 29But they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over.” So he went in to stay with them. 30When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. 31Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight. 32They said to each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us?” 33That same hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together. 34They were saying, “The Lord has risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!” 35Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread.

36While they were talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.” 37They were startled and terrified, and thought that they were seeing a ghost. 38He said to them, “Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? 39Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.” 40And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. 41While in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering, he said to them, “Have you anything here to eat?” 42They gave him a piece of broiled fish, 43and he took it and ate in their presence. 44Then he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you—that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms must be fulfilled.” 45Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures,46and he said to them, “Thus it is written, that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day, 47and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. 48You are witnesses of these things. 49And see, I am sending upon you what my Father promised; so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”

50Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and, lifting up his hands, he blessed them. 51While he was blessing them, he withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven. 52And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy; 53and they were continually in the temple blessing God.John1938After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, though a secret one because of his fear of the Jews, asked Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission; so he came and removed his body. 39Nicodemus, who had at first come to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds. 40They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths, according to the burial custom of the Jews. 41Now there was a garden in the place where he was crucified, and in the garden there was a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid. 42And so, because it was the Jewish day of Preparation, and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.201Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb. 2So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.” 3Then Peter and the other disciple set out and went toward the tomb. 4The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. 5He bent down to look in and saw the linen wrappings lying there, but he did not go in. 6Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen wrappings lying there, 7and the cloth that had been on Jesus’ head, not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself. 8Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; 9for as yet they did not understand the scripture, that he must rise from the dead. 10Then the disciples returned to their homes.

11But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb; 12and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. 13They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.” 14When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. 15Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?” Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.” 16Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to him in Hebrew, “Rabbouni!” (which means Teacher). 17Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’” 18Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord”; and she told them that he had said these things to her.

19When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” 20After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. 21Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.” 22When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit. 23If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.” 24But Thomas (who was called the Twin), one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.25So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.”

26A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” 27Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.” 28Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!” 29Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.” 30Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. 31But these are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life in his name.211After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias; and he showed himself in this way. 2Gathered there together were Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples. 3Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.” They said to him, “We will go with you.” They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing. 4Just after daybreak, Jesus stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 5Jesus said to them, “Children, you have no fish, have you?” They answered him, “No.” 6He said to them, “Cast the net to the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in because there were so many fish. 7That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on some clothes, for he was naked, and jumped into the sea. 8But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, only about a hundred yards off. 9When they had gone ashore, they saw a charcoal fire there, with fish on it, and bread. 10Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.” 11So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, a hundred fifty-three of them; and though there were so many, the net was not torn. 12Jesus said to them, “Come and have breakfast.” Now none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?” because they knew it was the Lord. 13Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. 14This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.

15When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my lambs.” 16A second time he said to him, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Tend my sheep.” 17He said to him the third time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time, “Do you love me?” And he said to him, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep. 18Very truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.” 19(He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God.) After this he said to him, “Follow me.”

20Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them; he was the one who had reclined next to Jesus at the supper and had said, “Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?” 21When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, “Lord, what about him?” 22Jesus said to him, “If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? Follow me!” 23So the rumor spread in the community that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, “If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?” 24This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them, and we know that his testimony is true. 25But there are also many other things that Jesus did; if every one of them were written down, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.",2315146,en,en,en,

A Quiet Normal Life,misc,Wallace Stevens,1954,80,{},"His place, as he sat and as he thought, was not
In anything that he constructed, so frail,
So barely lit, so shadowed over and naught,

As, for example, a world in which, like snow,
He became an inhabitant, obedient
To gallant notions on the part of cold.

It was here. This was the setting and the time
Of year. Here in his house and in his room,
In his chair, the most tranquil thought grew peaked

And the oldest and the warmest heart was cut
By gallant notions on the part of night—
Both late and alone, above the crickets' chords,

Babbling, each one, the uniqueness of its sound.
There was no fury in transcendent forms.
But his actual candle blazed with artifice.",595518,en,en,en,

The whole wheat was in aisle 23

Sure enough there it is on the middle shelf
I grabbed that whole wheat and put it in the cart
And I moved on and next was the dairy aisle
Grabbed the gallon skim and a pack of string cheese
Then I needed to get the sour cream
For my mother's homemade recipes
There's light, organic, natural, original
What's right?

I don't know. my mother never specified
What should I do?
There's hy-vee, daisy, Hiland, and don't forget the dean's too
There are so many options right in front of me, overwhelming me
After minutes of pondering
I went with the daisy light sour cream

Your potatoes, no the big starchy things

Sure enough, there they were

Put em in my car then headed up to the front

Now there's one person in front of me

I ? my cart
Then the cashier's waiting for me
He starts scanning the things
And he's like ""paper or plastic?""
I said ""I don't know""
""just let me think""

They have the same environmental impact
So yes I'll do ? today, today
Then the cashier said ""ok""

Trust

[Chorus:]
Yeah, Trusts a funny thing, cause yo ass can lose it in one day
And matter o' fact, once you do, it’s the hardest damn thing to gain
So I ain’t ever switching on my dawgs, and never trustin' snake
But where we live I swear to god it feel like everybody fake
Matter o' fact, had my closest friends just stab me in the back
That's a rat, all these people tryna use me for the cash
Feel like everybody’s tryna use me to get on the map
But there's one thing from me that you won’t ever mother fuckin have:
“Trust”

I got demons in my head
I got gold and lots a bread
Fall asleep holding my lead
But he got trust for her instead
When he ain't bringin' home the checks
Now she filled up with regret
And to alleviate the stress
She fuckin on her office desk
With her boss, just to get a pay raise
Gettin' off, at the thought, cause she likes to play games
Somethings off, when they talk, bout why she stayed late
She sobs, and sobs, just to save face
Uh, that's just a hoe
Shawty a snake but you never would know
I ain't ever switching up on my bros
So if you bout it then Im bout it for sure

I got diamonds on my chain
Never turn my back again
But he got trust for him in plain
When he just tryna make a name
Anything to ride the wave
So When he leave they call him lame
Cause he just use him for fame
Cut him off when he finally do it
And then you make him look awful by spreading the rumors
And he sayin that he didn’t but the media blew it
Now he’s all alone, and oh, so, clueless
Uh, that ain't a bro
Homie a snake but you never would know

Welcome To Planet X Were Coming For You,rap,KXNG Crooked,2016,25292,"{Eminem,""The Observer""}","[Intro: Eminem]
I live in a world that's different than your world
Your world still believes in things like free speech and democracy
Those things don't exist in my world anymore
Welcome to my world
Welcome to Planet X motherfucker

[Verse 1: KXNG CROOKED]
It used to be parks
Used to be jungle gyms
Now they just stories passed down orally from my great-grandmother Nem
It used to be public pools
Kids loved to swim 'til the summer's end
Now it's enough poison in the water to slaughter your son and your daughter
You can blame the government
Let me tell you how it all started
The middle class was evaporated then the filthy rich couldn't stand the stench of the dirt
Poor of course who had the world oversaturated
So a new world order was activated
No more black, no more white, no more brown, no more yellow, no more red
Just high born citizens and low born citizens
And all that race shit was eradicated
You're either rich or you're poor now
Digital identity chip implanted in everybody born now
Being poor is like fighting a war now
No energy to fight the real enemy because you're worn out
Living life on a tight rope, but the trickery is the tight rope
It's slippery as a ice slope
Every second somebody is falling off
So we figure we embrace the misery
Nigga we never liked hope
'Cause hope was the buzzword
That they used to brainwash us, fuck that, we unlearn
Now the rich people concerned
'Cause they know our return is confirmed by holding a gun firm
What's that in the distance?
You fucked slums raw 'til they gave birth to a resistance
You scared looking at your window
You see your own fucking children crawling over your fences
[Chorus: The Observer]
One by one they all come slow to meet their fates
And two by two I bury them in the shallow graves (I bury them, I bury them)
And three by three they've come at me, their guns and swords were drawn
Now four by four before the Lord they'll choose a witchy spawn
'Cause we're coming for you
(Coming for, coming for, coming for you, coming for you, coming for, coming for you)
La la la la la we're coming for you
La la la la la we're coming for you

[Verse 2: KXNG CROOKED]
Yo, what you gon' do now?
It's too late for talking, I'm in your face with the tool out
Foot wearing the other shoe now
The chickens came home to roost now
Who got the juice now?
Aye yo, what you gon' do now?
You want the truce now?
I'm in your face with the tool out
Foot wearing the other shoe now
The chickens came home to roost now
Who got the juice now?
Oil addiction, water pollution
(Who got the juice now?)
Soil contamination and over consumption
(Tell me who got the juice now?)
Wiped out two thirds of the planets fresh water
(Who got the juice now?)
And crop reserves creating a vast wasteland on a global scale
(Who got the juice?)
[Chorus: The Observer]
One by one they all come slow to meet their fates
And two by two I bury them in the shallow graves (I bury them, I bury them)

We'll blame the sky
If we need a reason why
We'll blame the sky

Get it together or forever hold your peace

Said you could feel the ticking and the tock of indecision

It just does not stop (stop, stop)
It never ends
Like a precious blend of life
Wrapped into heavens winds
Like sex and infinite
With every second and minute
Sending love for his missing
Killing, stressing and sinning
Then it begins. You meet her
And the first eternal cycle of life seems to occour
First your vision is blurred
Trying to figure out how to get her peeps jockin
Til you eavesdropping listening to her words
First time ""love at first sight""
Is relevant in your life
A glow like an angel on earth
Her soul was so bright that your nights become

Days
One way or another she'll discover your praise
And someday you'll be
Lovers
That's just to say the least
And if you ever get the guts to speak
Nothing but a couple of feet away from
Making love complete
But you love the discreet thoughts that cross in your mind and that's it
Like an isolated island in the sunshine, is that chick
Next day, the same shit, same time, same impression you get
Same kinda
Feeling killing your mind cause you're too shy to say shit
Not even ""hi""
Wishing a perceptual state
So you visit this same place envisioning
The chick as a fix for this
Silent as a predator
The prey you stay picturing
Your souls walk across the ocean
Both talking of emotions
'til your
Hearts' caught in a moment
Of an omen called love
Supposed
To last forever
Awakened by a waiter asking if you have his cheddar
And you realise nothing can be better than having
The pleasure of sitting at
The table that she's giggling at
But never will you ever get at that so you smile
While the world continues
And thoughts sink you to the clouds
Where Flora Purim
Sings of dreams
And you absorb the never ending
Feeling that you're living for nothing more
Than her.   ",105892,en,en,en,1lQi2A0u2xURcB37Dq5Rrm

Nakamichi tape system, bass bumps in pistons
Rolling stones when I'm hanging with the Christians
Will the real spit it?  It's a different world, get it?
Get it how you live it—pimpin' pants ain't fittin'
High water, high water, walk like a pigeon
Maybe an Egyptian with my higher hieroglyphics
Thirty-three degrees and my pyramid prolific
Eye of Providence in the sky and it's lifted
Universal rhymes, unlimited, gifted
God rest your soul—you got higher business
Please bear witness, pull wisdom like a dentist
Hit you with my fitness, cut you off in mid-sentence
I am the Celebrity and you are my Apprentice
Word on the street, in the gutter, in the ditches
Word to the beat, in the corner, in the benches
Wonderful like Nas - It Was Written

[Hook: Cise Star] (x2)
""Jerry is a fire.  I'm a Nazca Line writer
Peasant in the present.  In the future, call me sire
From humble beginnings and then became a sire
I'm a fighter.""  So say we all—take it higher

Did it for the living but the dead ain't kickin'
Team is supreme—Nakamichi tape system
Fuck your tape piss—I'm a clean, good listen
Equalize the lined up, bass boost hittin'
Doing what I do, but comment allez-vous?
Just breaking all the rules when I'm hanging out with Zeus
New red shoes and my Mercedes is bulletproof
Yes, I'm working miracles, doing shit you'll never do
Call me incredible, dopest intellectual
Turn it up a decibel.  I'm yelling through your sectional
So unforgettable, putting on a spectacle
Christen out the priest in confessional
Maybe unprofessional but I get the job done, crazy
Drink a glass of milk, water my plant, gravy
Think like a man while you acting like a lady
Cise Star here to save the babies

Underhanded deals 'cause you get it how you feel
Wheels made of steel—ATLiens are real

Just a son of a King like my name was Joe Hill
See me in the stars like the Greco-Roman gods
Like 2012-12-22 party hard
Like 1999, 2000 was just fine
Count down with closed eyes—we live or all die
Reason to the rhyme just tequila in a line
Captain of the buzz while you listen to the CYNE
Stop that, play, and then just rewind
Evolution of intelligent design
Rise

All around that old ghost town

Through these empty streets

Of the past
True love is a city
Built on endless dreams
Our town was never
Built to last
Darlin' you'll always be my friend
Though I hated you until the bitter end
Coz you took my love and weighed it down
And left it in that old ghost town

Go a-walkin'
When I'm lost
I search for homeward bound
Somehow every road
I end up takin'
Leads me to that

Did you think I’d forget what you said to me?
Layin on my bed, said ‘I think we’re meant to be’
Why the fuck you lie to me, is there something wrong with me?
If I’m being honest, I think you’re just tryna get to me
That’s the coldest shit I’ve ever seen

[In reverse]
I live in a constant state of misery
I think that if I were to fade away, no one would miss me
So if I fuck around and die, then you will know why
Yeah, you’ll know why

Tried to forget you
Livin’ out my own way
Talk to impress you
Using up this whole day
Thinkin’ of someone
I’ve been waiting ‘round for a neck kiss
For a neck kiss

I’m so sorry I let you down
What goes around comes back around
And though I tried to close my eyes, the sight of you is still in my mind
That’s the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard

I wonder if you love me are you party to show it

Or undressed my best embellishment left me to my buffoon
And the rest is yet to betterment relishing in a toon
But if I ever got the chance I would dance with you to the moon
And leave askance all the prancing and lancing to be your loon
And swoon with you and croon a tune booning a love in bloom

Norman bates, how i shoot, yea i luv u that's the truth

I been goin' thru the motions like i fuckin been sedated
Take one more, for the pain, then i times that shxt by 80

And u know it's fuck that nigga that 'chu datin'
Three nights i stayed up waitin'

Say it twice yea i luv u but i hate 'chu
Say it twice yea i luv u but u hate 'chu
Free time but 'chu came collect
Can't connect

Drop ya damn dress then we trade the neck
All the shxt that feel so distant

Feel like a memory, from another century, i can't let it get to me, everything u meant to me, feelin' penitentiary, put it in a summary
U take control of me as if this was ventriloquy

Hell sent 'chu was suffocating
Dysregulated, still debatin'

Say it twice yea i luv u but i hate 'chu",5795906,en,en,en,3SmFXevMI9zlG4VtjGcmFc

[Emcee(s): Fatal and Black Sun]
[Producer(s): Nick Wiz]
[Scratches: DJ Slyce]

[Verse 1: Fatal and Native Assassins]
As you
Look into my eyes, you know exactly what I’m thinking
Reaching for my Glock while your heart is steadily sinking
I got my victims all locked down tighter than Hannibal Lecter
Scheming on ways to get money from sector to sector
Robbing niggas at night, I get a quick stalk, murdering
Suckers in my mind as soon as I enter the dark
Give me any hesitation, and I’ll pistol-whip you, G
Land you on the pavement face-down and a scar to remember me
Black bastard at midnight with baggy jeans, robbing
Victims with less niggas than members of the A-Team
Ringing brothers’ bells on the regular like I was a
Public payphone, so I’m even taking quarters home
Causing a rampage ‘cause I bum-rush your pockets
When it comes to your change [?]
Giving sisters a hard time and hang onto their checks
With me, the ghetto IRS, and I’m coming to collect
Your back taxes, making suckers fill out forms
While running up in schools, robbing kids in college dorms
Playing in the game with no heart, shredding apart
Chumps’ pockets like a Black+Decker Cuisinart
Robbing couples while they’re sleeping, just call me a
Third-party of your love life while I’m in your bedroom creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping on that ass!
Strap on a mask and watch a nigga blast!
[Hook: Native Assassins]
Strap on the mask!  I think we got a victim!
Brrr!  Stick ‘em!  Ha, ha, ha, stick ‘em!
Strap on the mask!  I think we got a victim!
Brrr!  Stick ‘em!  Ha, ha, ha, stick ‘em!

[Verse 2: Black Sun]
Dum-da-
-dum-dum, I’m ready to come like a dick that’s hard [?]
[?] Johnny Carson, wanna
Blast!  And, yo, I wanna buck ‘em.  I’m warning ya
Drive a nail just to deliver you niggas to the coroner
Sticking brothers like a porcupine, my nine Beretta’s busting
I’m robbing everyone [?] ragamuffins
You huff, huff, huffing and puff, puff, puffing is nothing
Keep hollow tips for hostages that think I’m bluffing
Freeze!  I ain’t got shit to lose, so [?]
I’m sticking on a Midnight Run like De Niro
Say who’s mad ill, put the barrel in his grill, snatch
The bills.  I’m rushing through the doors like it’s a fire drill
Madman [?] I’m quick to misbehave, I’ll slap
A clip up, dig up your pockets like Kennedy’s grave
Yeah!  Remember me?  The nigga [?] vanity
I’m feeling kind of broke.  The crystal smokes?  It has the remedy
Code red!  Bald-heads and dreads and braids and fades
Get sprayed like Raid if niggas even look paid
Stick-up assassin coming in blasting
Security guards and squads, and all cash I keep stashing
[Hook: Native Assassins]
Strap on the mask!  I think we got a victim!
Brrr!  Stick ‘em!  Ha, ha, ha, stick ‘em!
Strap on the mask!  I think we got a victim!
Brrr!  Stick ‘em!  Ha, ha, ha, stick ‘em!

[Bridge 1: Native Assassins and Sample with Scratches by DJ Slyce]
“Stick up, blast ‘em!” Stick ‘em!  Stick ‘em!
“Stick up, blast ‘em!” Stick ‘em!  Stick ‘em!
“Stick up, blast ‘em!” Stick ‘em!  Stick ‘em!
“Stick up, blast ‘em!” Stick ‘em!  Stick ‘em!
Bank stop, nigga!  I ain’t got shit to lose
Bank stop, nigga!  I ain’t got shit to lose
Bank stop, nigga!  I ain’t got shit to lose
“Freeze!  Hands in the air!  Nobody move!”

[Verse 3: Black Sun, Fatal, and Native Assassins]
You know
The flavor on the stick-up data.  If the dice
Rolls in your favor, start stashing your papers, hit
The deck!  Pop the TEC, time to collect, kid
I’m blasting niggas in the back like Bernhard Goetz.  [?]
[?] stretch your pockets inside-out.  I’m sucking
Out your loot like a dentist cleaning out your mouth
No joke, leaving niggas broke, robbing everything
From motherfucking sneakers to their nickel bags [?].  You move
You lose.  I’m down The Bricks on Two-Fifth, robbing
Cee-lo games—a nigga rolled trips, and I flipped.  Aww
Shit!  Head cracked, get gats!
Just call me Dick Gregory when pockets get fat.  Give up
Your jewels and lose your tools.  Act a fool
And you’ll be stranded like Clint Eastwood in The Dead Pool
Native Assassins!  Nobody’s laughing!  I’m leaving
Niggas tied up in the streets, choking and gagging
[Outro: Native Assassins and Sample with Scratches by DJ Slyce]

Puts the pain in reverse

Baseball Kinda Sucks and So Does Everything,rap,YELLOW STEVE,2018,162,{},"I take two aspirin a day, my thoughts hurt
Been in my room for some ages
We ain’t touch bases like he think he safe
But baseball kinda sucks, and so does everything
The weather’s getting better, but no one to give my sweaters to
So what’s the point like broken pencils
Smoke ‘til i’m forgetful of the stress
It’s all mental, i think
Can’t circumvent it like a thunderstorm
I need my umbrella
I’ve seen better days like Bella Thorne
I’m hella bored like Flower Boy or Scrabble
Spent the last 3 or 4 days or so contemplating if I think i’m capable of...anything
I’m fed up like a shitty buffet
I’m anorexic now, ironic cause I’m full of shit
I kick rocks like Toph, I’m Appa with the yips
Anxious ‘cause I’ve made enough mistakes that I can’t face
‘cause I’m afraid
I‘m major tom in space, can I just fade-away?
I think the Lakers play today
Take the jay, I bank it, but I’m broke and broken
Jokes I mean i’m okie-dokie
Saving face like make-up
And this the first and last time I’ll say this shit to anyone
Not taking no more fucking pictures ‘til you fucking pay me
I’m sorry i’m just angry
But the statement stands like white people and the national anthem
I kinda got off topic there, apologies
A lot on my mind like all of the time
It’s kind of overwhelming like my Twitter feed
Just little me pitched against the Internet

The History of England Vol.I.  Chap 1.45,misc,David Hume,1754,42,{},"James I


1603.

The crown of England was never transmitted from father to son with greater tranquillity than it passed from the family of Tudor to that of Stuart. During the whole reign of Elizabeth, the eyes of men had been employed in search of her successor; and when old age made the prospect of her death more immediate, there appeared none but the king of Scots who could advance any just claim or pretension to the throne. He was great-grandson of Margaret, elder daughter of Henry VII.; and, on the failure of the male line, his hereditary right remained unquestionable. If the religion of Mary queen of Scots, and the other prejudices contracted against her, had formed any considerable obstacle to her succession, these objections, being entirely personal, had no place with regard to her son. Men also considered, that though the title derived from blood had been frequently violated since the Norman conquest, such licenses had proceeded more from force or intrigue than from any deliberate maxims of government. The lineal heir had still in the end prevailed: and both his exclusion and restoration had been commonly attended with such convulsions as were sufficient to warn all prudent men not lightly to give way to such irregularities. If the will of Henry VIII., authorized by act of parliament, had tacitly excluded the Scottish line, the tyranny and caprices of that monarch had been so signal, that a settlement of this nature, unsupported by any just reason, had no authority with the people. Queen Elizabeth, too, with her dying breath, had recognized the undoubted title of her kinsman James; and the whole nation seemed to dispose themselves with joy and pleasure for his reception. Though born and educated amidst a foreign and hostile people, men hoped, from his character of moderation and wisdom, that he would embrace the maxims of an English monarch; and the prudent foresaw greater advantages resulting from a union with Scotland, than disadvantages from submitting to a prince of that nation. The alacrity with which the English looked towards the successor had appeared so evident to Elizabeth, that, concurring, with other causes, it affected her with the deepest melancholy; and that wise princess, whose penetration and experience had given her the greatest insight into human affairs, had not yet, sufficiently weighed the ingratitude of courtiers and levity of the people.

As victory abroad and tranquillity at home had attended this princess, she left the nation in such flourishing circumstances, that her successor possessed every advantage, except that of comparison with her illustrious name, when he mounted the throne of England. The king's journey from Edinburgh to London immediately afforded to the inquisitive some circumstances of comparison, which even the natural partiality in favor of their new sovereign could not interpret to his advantage. As he passed along, all ranks of men flocked about him from every quarter, allured by interest or curiosity. Great were the rejoicings, and loud and hearty the acclamations, which resounded from all sides; and every one could remember how the affability and popular manners of their queen displayed themselves amidst such concourse and exultation of her subjects. But James, though sociable and familiar with his friends and courtiers, hated the bustle of a mixed multitude; and though far from disliking flattery, yet was he still fonder of tranquillity and ease. He issued, therefore, a proclamation, forbidding this resort of people, on pretence of the scarcity of provisions, and other inconveniencies, which, he said, would necessarily attend it.[*]

       &nbsp* Kennet, p. 662.

He was not, however, insensible to the great flow of affection which appeared in his new subjects; and being himself of an affectionate temper, he seems to have been in haste to make them some return of kindness and good offices. To this motive, probably, we are to ascribe that profusion of titles which was observed in the beginning of his reign; when, in six weeks' time after his entrance into the kingdom, he is computed to have bestowed knighthood on no less than two hundred and thirty-seven persons. If Elizabeth's frugality of honors, as well as of money, had formerly been repined at, it began now to be valued and esteemed, and every one was sensible that the king, by his lavish and premature conferring of favors, had failed of obliging the persons on whom he bestowed them. Titles of all kinds became so common, that they were scarcely marks of distinction; and being distributed, without choice or deliberation, to persons unknown to the prince, were regarded more as the proofs of facility and good nature, than of any determined friendship or esteem.

       &nbspA pasquinade was affixed to St. Paul's, in which an art was promised to be taught, very necessary to assist frail memories in retaining the names of the new nobility.[*]

We may presume that the English would have thrown less blame on the king's facility in bestowing favors, had these been confined entirely to their own nation, and had not been shared out, in too unequal proportions, to his old subjects. James, who, through his whole reign, was more guided by temper and inclination than by the rules of political prudence, had brought with him great numbers of his Scottish courtiers, whose impatience and importunity were apt, in many particulars, to impose on the easy nature of their master, and extort favors of which, it is natural to imagine, his English subjects would loudly complain. The duke of Lenox, the earl of Marre, Lord Hume, Lord Kinloss, Sir George Hume, Secretary Elphinstone,[**] were immediately added to the English privy council. Sir George Hume, whom he created earl of Dunbar, was his declared favorite as long as that nobleman lived, and was one of the wisest and most virtuous, though the least powerful, of all those whom the king ever honored with that distinction. Hay, some time after, was created Viscount Doncaster, then earl of Carlisle, and got an immense fortune from the crown, all which he spent in a splendid and courtly manner. Ramsay obtained the title of earl of Holderness; and many others being raised on a sudden to the highest elevation, increased, by their insolence, that envy which naturally attended them as strangers and ancient enemies.

       &nbsp* Wilson, in Kennet, p. 665.

       &nbsp** Wilson, in Kennet, p. 662.
It must, however, be owned, in justice to James, that he left almost all the chief offices in the hands of Elizabeth's ministers, and trusted the conduct of political concerns, both foreign and domestic, to his English subjects. Among these, Secretary Cecil, created successively Lord Effindon, Viscount Cranborne, and earl of Salisbury, was always regarded as his prime minister and chief counsellor. Though the capacity and penetration of this minister were sufficiently known, his favor with the king created surprise on the accession of that monarch. The secret correspondence into which he had entered with James, and which had sensibly contributed to the easy reception of that prince in England, laid the foundation of Cecil's credit; and while all his former associates, Sir Walter Raleigh, Lord Grey, Lord Cobham, were discountenanced on account of their animosity against Essex, as well as for other reasons, this minister was continued in employment, and treated with the greatest confidence and regard.

The capacity of James and his ministers in negotiation was immediately put to trial on the appearance of ambassadors from almost all the princes and states of Europe, in order to congratulate him on his accession, and form with him new treaties and alliances. Besides ministers from Venice, Denmark, the Palatinate; Henry Frederic of Nassau, assisted by Barnevelt, the pensionary of Holland, was ambassador from the states of the United Provinces. Aremberg was sent by Archduke Albert, and Taxis was expected in a little time from Spain. But he who most excited the attention of the public, both on account of his own merit and that of his master, was the marquis of Rosni, afterwards duke of Sully, prime minister and favorite of Henry IV. of France.

When the dominions of the house of Austria devolved on Philip II., all Europe was struck with terror, lest the power of a family, which had been raised by fortune, should now be carried to an immeasurable height by the wisdom and conduct of this monarch. But never were apprehensions found in the event to be more groundless. Slow without prudence, ambitious without enterprise, false without deceiving any body, and refined without any true judgment; such was the character of Philip, and such the character which, during his lifetime, and after his death, he impressed on the Spanish councils. Revolted or depopulated provinces, discontented or indolent inhabitants, were the spectacles which those dominions, lying in every climate of the globe, presented to Philip III., a weak prince, and to the duke of Lerma, a minister weak and odious. But though military discipline, which still remained, was what alone gave some appearance of life and vigor to that languishing body, yet so great was the terror produced by former power and ambition, that the reduction of the house of Austria was the object of men's vows throughout all the states of Christendom. It was not perceived, that the French empire, now united in domestic peace, and governed by the most heroic and most amiable prince that adorns modern story, was become, of itself, a sufficient counterpoise to the Spanish greatness. Perhaps that prince himself did not perceive it, when he proposed, by his minister, a league with James, in conjunction with Venice, the United Provinces, and the northern crowns, in order to attack the Austrian dominions on every side, and depress the exorbitant power of that ambitious family.[*] But the genius of the English monarch was not equal to such vast enterprises. The love of peace was his ruling passion; and it was his peculiar felicity, that the conjunctures of the times rendered the same object which was agreeable to him in the highest degree advantageous to his people.

The French ambassador, therefore, was obliged to depart from these extensive views, and to concert with James the means of providing for the safety of the United Provinces: nor was this object altogether without its difficulties. The king, before his accession, had entertained scruples with regard to the revolt of the Low Countries; and being commonly open and sincere,[**] he had, on many occasions, gone so far as to give to the Dutch the appellation of rebels; [***] but having conversed more fully with English ministers and courtiers, he found their attachment to that republic so strong, and their opinion of common interest so established, that he was obliged to sacrifice to politics his sense of justice; a quality which, even when erroneous, is respectable as well as rare in a monarch.

       &nbsp* Sully's Memoirs.

       &nbsp** La Boderie, voL i. p. 120.

       &nbsp*** Winwood, vol. ii. p 55.

He therefore agreed with Rosni to support secretly the states general, in concert with the king of France; lest their weakness and despair should oblige them to submit to their old master. The articles of the treaty were few and simple. It was stipulated, that the two kings should allow the Dutch to levy forces in their respective dominions; and should underhand remit to that republic the sum of one million four hundred thousand livres a year, for the pay of these forces: that the whole sum should be advanced by the king of France; but that the third of it should be deducted from the debt due by him to Queen Elizabeth. And if the Spaniards attacked either of the princes, they agreed to assist each other; Henry with a force of ten thousand men, James with that of six. This treaty, one of the wisest and most equitable concluded by James during the course of his reign was more the work of the prince himself, than any of his ministers.[*]

Amidst the great tranquillity, both foreign and domestic with which the nation was blest, nothing could be more surprising than the discovery of a conspiracy to subvert the government, and to fix on the throne Arabella Stuart, a near relation of the king's by the family of Lenox, and descended equally from Henry VII. Every thing remains still mysterious in this conspiracy; and history can give us no clew to unravel it. Watson and Clarke, two Catholic priests, were accused of the plot; Lord Grey, a Puritan; Lord Cobham, a thoughtless man, of no fixed principle; and Sir Walter Raleigh, suspected to be of that philosophical sect who were then extremely rare in England, and who have since received the appellation of ""Free-thinkers;"" together with these, Mr. Broke, brother to Lord Cobham, Sir Griffin Markham, Mr. Copeley, Sir Edward Parham. What cement could unite men of-such discordant principles in so dangerous a combination, what end they proposed, or what means proportioned to an undertaking of this nature, has never yet been explained, and cannot easily be imagined. As Raleigh, Grey, and Cobham were commonly believed, after the queen's death, to have opposed proclaiming the king till conditions should be made with him, they were, upon that account, extremely obnoxious to the court and ministry; and people were apt, at first, to suspect that the plot was merely a contrivance of Secretary Cecil, to get rid of his old confederates, now become his most inveterate enemies. But the confession, as well as trial, of the criminals, put the matter beyond doubt.[**] And though no one could find any marks of a concerted enterprise, it appeared that men of furious and ambitious spirits, meeting frequently together, and believing all the world discontented like themselves, had entertained very criminal projects, and had even entered, some of them at least, into a correspondence with Aremberg, the Flemish ambassador in order to give disturbance to the new settlement.

The two priests[*] and Broke[**] were executed: Cobham, Grey, and Markham were pardoned,[***] after they had laid their heads upon the block.[****] Raleigh too was reprieved, not pardoned; and he remained in confinement many years afterwards.

It appears from Sully's Memoirs, that Raleigh secretly offered his services to the French ambassador; and we may thence presume that, meeting with a repulse from that quarter, he had recourse, for the same unwarrantable purposes, to the Flemish minister. Such a conjecture we are now enabled to form; but it must be confessed, that on his trial there appeared no proof of this transaction, nor indeed any circumstance which could justify his condemnation. He was accused by Cobham alone, in a sudden fit of passion, upon hearing that Raleigh, when examined, had pointed out some circumstances by which Cobham's guilt might be known and ascertained. This accusation Cobham afterwards retracted; and, soon after, he retracted his retractation. Yet upon the written evidence of this single witness, a man of no honor or understanding, and so contradictory in his testimony; not confronted with Raleigh; not supported by any concurring circumstance; was that great man, contrary to all law and equity, found guilty by the jury. His name was at that time extremely odious in England; and every man was pleased to give sentence against the capital enemy of Essex, the favorite of the people.
Sir Edward Coke, the famous lawyer, then attorney-general, managed the cause for the crown, and threw out on Raleigh such gross abuse, as may be deemed a great reflection, not only on his own memory, but even, in some degree, on the manners of the age. Traitor, monster, viper, and spider of hell, are the terms which he employs against one of the most illustrious men of the kingdom, who was under trial for life and fortune, and who defended himself with temper, eloquence, and courage.[v]

       &nbspThe next occupation of the king was entirely according to his heart's content. He was employed in dictating magisterially to an assembly of divines concerning points of faith and discipline, and in receiving the applauses of these holy men for his superior zeal and learning. The religious disputes between the church and the Puritans had induced him to call a conference at Hampton Court, on pretence of finding expedients which might reconcile both parties.

Though the severities of Elizabeth towards the Catholics had much weakened that party, whose genius was opposite to the prevailing spirit of the nation, like severities had had so little influence on the Puritans, who were encouraged by that spirit, that no less than seven hundred and fifty clergymen of that party signed a petition to the king on his accession; and many more seemed willing to adhere to it.[*]

       &nbsp* Fuller, book x. Collier, vol. ii. p. 672.

They all hoped that James, having received his education in Scotland, and having sometimes professed an attachment to the church established there, would at least abate the rigor of the laws enacted in support of the ceremonies, and against Puritans; if he did not show more particular grace and encouragement to that sect. But the king's disposition had taken strongly a contrary bias. The more he knew the Puritanical clergy, the less favor he bore to them. He had remarked in their Scottish brethren a violent turn towards republicanism, and a zealous attachment to civil liberty; principles nearly allied to that religious enthusiasm with which they were actuated. He had found, that being mostly persons of low birth and mean education, the same lofty pretensions which attended them in their familiar addresses to their Maker, of whom they believed themselves the peculiar favorites, induced them to use the utmost freedoms with their earthly sovereign. In both capacities, of monarch and of theologian, he had experienced the little complaisance which they were disposed to show him; whilst they controlled his commands, disputed his tenets, and to his face, before the whole people, censured his conduct and behavior. If he had submitted to the indignity of courting their favor, he treasured up, on that account, the stronger resentment against them, and was determined to make them feel, in their turn, the weight of his authority. Though he had often met with resistance, and faction, and obstinacy in the Scottish nobility, he retained no ill will to that order; or rather showed them favor and kindness in England, beyond what reason and sound policy could well justify; but the ascendant which the Presbyterian clergy had assumed over him, was what his monarchical pride could never thoroughly digest.[*]

       &nbsp* James ventured to say, in his Basilicon Duron, published
       &nbspwhile he was in Scotland, ""I protest before the great God,
       &nbspand since I am here as upon my Testament, it is no place for
       &nbspme to lie in, that ye shall never find with any highland or
       &nbspborderer thieves, greater in gratitude, and more lies and
       &nbspvile perjuries, than with these fanatic spirits: and suffer
       &nbspnot the principal of them to brook your land,""—King James's
       &nbspWorks, p. 161.
He dreaded likewise the popularity which attended this order of men in both kingdoms. As useless austerities and self-denial are imagined, in many religions, to render us acceptable to a benevolent Being, who created us solely for happiness, James remarked, that the rustic severity of these clergymen, and of their whole sect, had given them, in the eyes of the multitude, the appearance of sanctity and virtue. Strongly inclined himself to mirth, and wine, and sports of all kinds, he apprehended their censure for his manner of life, free and disengaged. And being thus averse, from temper as well as policy, to the sect of Puritans, he was resolved, if possible, to prevent its further growth in England.

But it was the character of James's councils, throughout his whole reign, that they were more wise and equitable in their end, than prudent and political in the means. Though justly sensible that no part of civil administration required greater care or a nicer judgment than the conduct of religious parties, he had not perceived that, in the same proportion as this practical knowledge of theology is requisite, the speculative refinements in it are mean, and even dangerous in a monarch. By entering zealously into frivolous disputes, James gave them an air of importance and dignity which they could not otherwise have acquired; and being himself enlisted in the quarrel, he could no longer have recourse to contempt and ridicule, the only proper method of appeasing it. The church of England had not yet abandoned the rigid doctrines of grace and pre-destination: the puritans had not yet separated themselves from the church, nor openly renounced Episcopacy. Though the spirit of the parties was considerably different, the only appearing subjects of dispute were concerning the cross in baptism, the ring in marriage, the use of the surplice, and the bowing at the name of Jesus. These were the mighty questions which were solemnly agitated in the conference at Hampton Court between some bishops and dignified clergymen on the one hand, and some leaders of the Puritanical party on the other, the king and his ministers being present.[*]

The Puritans were here so unreasonable as to complain of a partial and unfair management of the dispute; as if the search after truth were in any degree the object of such conferences, and a candid indifference, so rare even among private inquirers in philosophical questions, could ever be expected among princes and prelates, in a theological controversy. The king, it must be confessed, from the beginning of the conference, showed the strongest propensity to the established church, and frequently inculcated a maxim which, though it has some foundation, is to be received with great limitations, ""No bishop, no king."" The bishops, in their turn, were very liberal of their praises towards the royal disputant; and the archbishop of Canterbury said, that ""undoubtedly his majesty spake by the special assistance of God's Spirit.""[**] A few alterations in the liturgy were agreed to, and both parties separated with mutual dissatisfaction.

It had frequently been the practice of the Puritans to form certain assemblies, which they called ""prophesyings;"" where alternately, as moved by the spirit, they displayed their pious zeal in prayers and exhortations, and raised their own enthusiasm, as well as that of their audience, to the highest pitch, from that social contagion which has so mighty an influence on holy fervors, and from the mutual emulation which arose in those trials of religious eloquence. Such dangerous societies had been suppressed by Elizabeth; and the ministers in this conference moved the king for their revival. But James sharply replied, ""If you aim at a Scottish presbytery, it agrees as well with monarchy as God and the devil. There Jack and Tom, and Will and Dick, shall meet and censure me and my council. Therefore I reiterate my former speech: Le roi s'avisera. Stay, I pray, for one seven years, before you demand; and then, if you find me grow pursy and fat, I may perchance hearken unto you. For that government will keep me in breath, and give me work enough.""[***] Such were the political considerations which determined the king in his choice among religious parties.

The next assembly in which James displayed his learning and eloquence, was one that showed more spirit of liberty than appeared among his bishops and theologians The parliament was now ready to assemble; being so long delayed on account of the plague, which had broken out in London, and raged to such a degree, that above thirty thousand persons are computed to have died of it in a year; though the city contained at that time little more than one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants.

The speech which the king made on opening the parliament, fully displays his character, and proves him to have possessed more knowledge and better parts, than prudence, or any just sense of decorum and propriety.[*] Though few productions of the age surpass this performance either in style or matter, it wants that majestic brevity and reserve which become a king in his addresses to the great council of the nation. It contains, however, a remarkable stroke of candor, where he confesses his too great facility in yielding to the solicitations of suitors:[**] a fault which he promises to correct, but which adhered to him, and distressed him, during the whole course of his reign.

The first business in which the commons were engaged was of the utmost importance to the preservation of their privileges; and neither temper nor resolution was wanting in their conduct of it.

In the former periods of the English government, the house of commons was of so small weight in the balance of the constitution, that little attention had been given either by the crown, the people, or the house itself, to the choice and continuance of the members. It had been usual, after parliaments were prolonged beyond one session, for the chancellor to exert a discretionary authority of issuing new writs to supply the place of any members whom he judged incapable of attending, either on account of their employment, their sickness, or other impediment. This practice gave that minister, and consequently the prince, an unlimited power of modelling at pleasure the representatives of the nation; yet so little jealousy had it created, that the commons of themselves, without any court influence or intrigue, and contrary to some former votes of their own, confirmed it in the twenty-third of Elizabeth.[***]

At that time, though some members, whose places had been supplied on account of sickness, having now recovered their health, appeared in the house and claimed their seat, such was the authority of the chancellor, that, merely out of respect to him, his sentence was adhered to, and the new members were continued in their places. Here a most dangerous prerogative was conferred on the crown: but to show the genius of that age, or rather the channels in which power then ran, the crown put very little value on this authority; insomuch that two days afterwards the chancellor of himself resigned it back to the commons, and gave them power to judge of a particular vacancy in their house. And when the question concerning the chancellor's new writs was again brought on the carpet towards the end of the session, the commons were so little alarmed at the precedent, that though they readmitted some old members, whose seats had been vacated on account of slight indispositions, yet they confirmed the chancellor's sentence, in instances where the distemper appeared to have been dangerous and incurable.[*]

       &nbsp* Journ. March 18th, 1580. See further, D'Ewes, p 430.

Nor did they proceed any further in vindication of their privileges than to vote, ""That during the sitting of parliament, there do not, at any time, any writ go out for choosing or returning any member without the warrant of the house."" In Elizabeth's reign, we may remark, and the reigns preceding, sessions of parliament were not usually the twelfth part so long as the vacations; and during the latter, the chancellor's power, if he pleased to exert it, was confirmed, at least left, by this vote, as unlimited and unrestrained as ever.

In a subsequent parliament, the absolute authority of the queen was exerted in a manner still more open; and began for the first time to give alarm to the commons. New writs having been issued by the chancellor when there was no vacancy, and a controversy arising upon that incident, the queen sent a message to the house, informing them that it were impertinent for them to deal in such matters. These questions, she said, belonged only to the chancellor; and she had appointed him to confer with the judges, in order to settle all disputes with regard to elections. The commons had the courage, a few days after, to vote, ""That it was a most perilous precedent, where two knights of a county were duly elected, if any new writ should issue out for a second election without order of the house itself: that the discussing and adjudging of this and such like differences belonged only to the house; and that there should be no message sent to the lord chancellor, not so much as to inquire what he had done in the matter, because it was conceived to be a matter derogatory to the power and privilege of the house.""[*]
This is the most considerable, and almost only instance of parliamentary liberty, which occurs during the reign of that princess.

Outlaws, whether on account of debts or crimes, had been declared by the judges[*] incapable of enjoying a seat in the house, where they must themselves be lawgivers; but this opinion of the judges had been frequently overruled. I find, however, in the case of Vaughan,[**] who was questioned for an outlawry, that, having proved all his debts to have been contracted by suretyship, and to have been most of them honestly compounded, he was allowed, on account of these favorable circumstances, to keep his seat; which plainly supposes, that otherwise it would have been vacated on account of the outlawry.[***]

When James summoned this parliament, he issued a proclamation,[****] in which, among many general advices, which, like a kind tutor, he bestowed on his people, he strictly enjoins them not to choose any outlaw for their representative. And he adds, ""If any person take upon him the place of knight, citizen, or burgess, not being duly elected, according to the laws and statutes in that behalf provided, and according to the purport, effect, and true meaning of this our proclamation, then every person so offending to be fined or imprisoned for the same."" A proclamation here was plainly put on the same footing with a law, and that in so delicate a point as the right of elections; most alarming circumstances, had there not been reason to believe that this measure, being entered into so early in the king's reign, proceeded more from precipitation and mistake, than from any serious design of invading the privileges of parliament.[v]

Sir Francis Goodwin was chosen member for the county of Bucks; and his return, as usual, was made into chancery. The chancellor, pronouncing him an outlaw, vacated his seat and issued writs for a new election.[*] Sir John Fortescue was chosen in his place by the county: but the first act of the house was to reverse the chancellor's sentence, and restore Sir Francis to his seat. At the king's suggestion, the lords desired a conference on the subject; but were absolutely refused by the commons, as the question entirely regarded their own privileges.[**] The commons, however, agreed to make a remonstrance to the king by the mouth of their speaker; in which they maintained that, though the returns were by form made into chancery, yet the sole right of judging with regard to elections belonged to the house itself, not to the chancellor.[***] James was not satisfied, and ordered a conference between the house and the judges, whose opinion in this case was opposite to that of the commons. This conference, he said, he commanded as an ""absolute"" king;[****] an epithet, we are apt to imagine, not very grateful to English ears, but one to which they had already been somewhat accustomed from the mouth of Elizabeth.[v] 44 He added, ""That all their privileges were derived from his grant, and hoped they would not turn them against him;""[v*] a sentiment which, from her conduct, it is certain that princess had also entertained, and which was the reigning principle of her courtiers and ministers, and the spring of all her administration.

       &nbsp* The duke of Sully tells us, that it was a maxim of James,
       &nbspthat no prince, in the first year of his reign, should begin
       &nbspany considerable undertaking; a maxim reasonable in itself,
       &nbspand very suitable to his cautious, not to say timid
       &nbspcharacter. The facility with which he departed from this
       &nbsppretension, is another proof that his meaning was innocent.
       &nbspBut had the privileges of parliament been at that time
       &nbspexactly ascertained, or royal power fully limited, could
       &nbspsuch an imagination ever have been entertained by him, as to
       &nbspthink that his proclamations could regulate parliamentary

The commons were in some perplexity. Their eyes were now opened, and they saw the consequences of that power which had been assumed by the chancellor, and to which their predecessors had in some instances blindly submitted. ""By this course,"" said a member, ""the free election of the counties is taken away, and none shall be chosen but such as shall please the king and council. Let us therefore with fortitude, understanding, and sincerity, seek to maintain our privilege. This cannot be construed any contempt in us, but merely a maintenance of our common rights, which our ancestors have left us, and which it is just and fit for us to transmit to our posterity.""[*] Another said, ""This may be called a quo warranto to seize all our liberties.""[**] ""A chancellor,"" added a third, ""by this course may call a parliament consisting of what persons he pleases. Any suggestion, by any person, may be the cause of sending a new writ. It is come to this plain question, whether the chancery or parliament ought to have authority.""[***]

Notwithstanding this watchful spirit of liberty which now appeared in the commons, their deference for majesty was so great that they appointed a committee to confer with the judges before the king and council. There the question of law began to appear in James's eyes a little more doubtful than he had hitherto imagined it; and in order to extricate himself with some honor, he proposed that both Goodwin and Fortescue should be set aside, and a writ be issued, by warrant of the house, for a new election. Goodwin gave his consent, and the commons embraced the expedient; but in such a manner that, while they showed their regard for the king, they secured for the future the free possession of their seats, and the right which they claimed of judging solely in their own elections and returns.[****] 45

A power like this, so essential to the exercise of all their other powers, themselves so essential to public liberty, cannot fairly be deemed an encroachment in the commons; but must be regarded as an inherent privilege, happily rescued from that ambiguity which the negligence of some former parliaments had thrown upon it.

At the same time, the commons, in the case of Sir Thomas Shirley, established their power of punishing, as well the persons at whose suit any member is arrested, as the officers who either arrest or detain him. Their asserting of this privilege admits of the same reflection.[v]

About this period, the minds of men throughout Europe, especially in England, seem to have undergone a general but insensible revolution. Though letters had been revived in the preceding age, they were chiefly cultivated by those of sedentary professions; nor had they till now begun to spread themselves in any degree among men of the world. Arts, both mechanical and liberal, were every day receiving great improvements. Navigation had extended itself over the whole globe. Travelling was secure and agreeable. And the general system of politics in Europe was become more enlarged and comprehensive.

In consequence of this universal fermentation, the ideas of men enlarged themselves on all sides; and the several constituent parts of the Gothic governments, which seem to have lain long inactive, began everywhere to operate and encroach on each other. On the continent, where the necessity of discipline had begotten standing armies, the princes commonly established an unlimited authority, and overpowered, by force or intrigue, the liberties of the people. In England, the love of freedom, which, unless checked, flourishes extremely in all liberal natures, acquired new force, and was regulated by more enlarged views, suitable to that cultivated understanding which became every day more common among men of birth and education. A familiar acquaintance with the precious remains of antiquity excited in every generous breast a passion for a limited constitution, and begat an emulation of those manly virtues which the Greek and Roman authors, by such animating examples, as well as pathetic expressions, recommend to us. The severe, though popular government of Elizabeth had confined this rising spirit within very narrow bounds; but when a new and a foreign family succeeded to the throne, and a prince less dreaded and less beloved, symptoms immediately appeared of a more free and independent genius in the nation.

Happily, this prince possessed neither sufficient capacity to perceive the alteration, nor sufficient art and vigor to check it in its early advances. Jealous of regal, because conscious of little personal authority, he had established within his own mind a speculative system of absolute government, which few of his subjects, he believed, and none but traitors and rebels, would make any scruple to admit. On whichever side he cast his eye, every thing concurred to encourage his prejudices. When he compared himself with the other hereditary sovereigns of Europe, he imagined that, as he bore the same rank, he was entitled to equal prerogatives; not considering the innovations lately introduced by them, and the military force by which their authority was supported. In England, that power, almost unlimited, which had been exercised for above a century, especially during the late reign, he ascribed solely to royal birth and title; not to the prudence and spirit of the monarchs, nor to the conjunctures of the times. Even the opposition which he had struggled with in Scotland, encouraged him still further in his favorite notions; while he there saw, that the same resistance which opposed regal authority, violated all law and order, and made way either for the ravages of a barbarous nobility, or for the more intolerable insolence of seditious preachers. In his own person, therefore, he thought all legal power to be centred, by an hereditary and a divine right: and this opinion might have proved dangerous, if not fatal to liberty, had not the firmness of the persuasion, and its seeming evidence, induced him to trust solely to his right, without making the smallest provision, either of force or politics, in order to support it.

Such were the opposite dispositions of parliament and prince at the commencement of the Scottish line; dispositions just beginning to exist and to appear in the parliament,[*] 46 but thoroughly established and openly avowed on the part of the prince.

The spirit and judgment of the house of commons appeared, not only in defence of their own privileges, but also in their endeavor, though at this time in vain, to free trade from those shackles which the high exerted prerogative, and even, in this respect, the ill-judged tyranny of Elizabeth, had imposed upon it.

James had already, of his own accord, called in and annulled all the numerous patents for monopolies which had been granted by his predecessor, and which extremely fettered every species of domestic industry: but the exclusive companies still remained; another species of monopoly, by which almost all foreign trade, except that to France, was brought into the hands of a few rapacious engrossers, and all prospect of future improvement in commerce was forever sacrificed to a little temporary advantage of the sovereign. These companies, though arbitrarily erected, had carried their privileges so far, that almost all the commerce of England was centred in London; and it appears that the customs of that port amounted to one hundred and ten thousand pounds a year, while those of all the kingdom beside yielded only seventeen thousand.[*] Nay, the whole trade of London was confined to about two hundred citizens,[**] who were easily enabled, by combining among themselves, to fix whatever price they pleased both to the exports and imports of the nation. The committee appointed to consider this enormous grievance, one of the greatest which we read of in English story, insist on it as a fact well known and avowed, however contrary to present received opinion, that shipping and seamen had insensibly decayed during all the preceding reign.[***] And though nothing be more common than complaints of the decay of trade, even during the most flourishing periods, yet is this a consequence which might naturally result from such arbitrary establishments, at a time when the commerce of all the other nations of Europe, except that of Scotland, enjoyed full liberty and indulgence.

While the commons were thus attempting to give liberty to the trading part of the nation, they also endeavored to free the landed property from the burden of wardships,[****] and to remove those remains of the feudal tenures under which the nation still labored. A just regard was shown to the crown in the conduct of this affair; nor was the remedy sought for considered as a matter of right, but merely of grace and favor. The profit which the king reaped, both from wards and from respite of homage, was estimated; and it was intended to compound for these prerogatives by a secure and independent revenue. But after some debates in the house, and some conferences with the lords, the affair was found to contain more difficulties than could easily, at that time, be surmounted; and it was not then brought to any conclusion.

The same fate attended an attempt of a like nature, to free the nation from the burden of purveyance. This prerogative had been much abused by the purveyors;[v] and the commons showed some intention to offer the king fifty thousand pounds a year for the abolition of it.

Another affair of the utmost consequence was brought before the parliament, where the commons showed a greater spirit of independence than any true judgment of national interest. The union of the two kingdoms was zealously, and even impatiently, urged by the king.[*] He justly regarded it as the peculiar felicity of his reign, that he had terminated the bloody animosities of these hostile nations; and had reduced the whole island under one government, enjoying tranquillity within itself, and security from all foreign invasions. He hoped that, while his subjects of both kingdoms reflected on past disasters, besides regarding his person as infinitely precious, they would entertain the strongest desire of securing themselves against the return of like calamities, by a thorough union of laws, parliaments, and privileges. He considered not, that this very reflection operated, as yet, in a contrary manner on men's prejudices, and kept alive that mutual hatred between the nations, which had been carried to the greatest extremities, and required time to allay it. The more urgent the king appeared in promoting so useful a measure, the more backward was the English parliament in concurring with him; while they ascribed his excessive zeal to that partiality in favor of his ancient subjects, of which they thought that, on other occasions, they had reason to complain. Their complaisance for the king, therefore, carried them no further than to appoint forty-four English to meet with thirty-one Scottish commissioners, in order to deliberate concerning the terms of a union; but without any power of making advances towards the establishment of it.[**]

The same spirit of independence, and perhaps not better judgment, appeared in the house of commons when the question of supply was brought before them by some members attached to the court. In vain was it urged that, though the king received a supply which had been voted to Elizabeth, and which had not been collected before her death, yet he found it burdened with a debt contracted by the queen, equal to the full amount of it: that peace was not yet thoroughly concluded with Spain, and that Ireland was still expensive.

On his journey from Scotland, amidst such a concourse of people, and on that of the queen and royal family he had expended considerable sums; and that, as the courtiers had looked for greater liberalities from the prince on his accession, and had imposed on his generous nature, so the prince, in his turn, would expect, at the beginning, some mark of duty and attachment from his people, and some consideration of his necessities. No impression was made on the house of commons by these topics; and the majority appeared fully determined to refuse all supply. The burden of government, at that time, lay surprisingly light upon the people: and that very reason, which to us, at this distance, may seem a motive of generosity, was the real cause why the parliament was, on all occasions, so remarkably, frugal and reserved. They were not, as yet, accustomed to open their purses in so liberal a manner as their successors, in order to supply the wants of their sovereign; and the smallest demand, however requisite, appeared in their eyes unreasonable and exorbitant. The commons seem also to have been desirous of reducing the crown to still further necessities, by their refusing a bill, sent down to them by the lords, for entailing the crown lands forever on the king's heirs and successors.[*] The dissipation made by Elizabeth had probably taught James the necessity of this law, and shown them the advantage of refusing it.

In order to cover a disappointment with regard to supply, which might bear a bad construction both at home and abroad, James sent a message to the house,[*] in which he told them that he desired no supply; and he was very forward in refusing what was never offered him.

Soon after, he prorogued the parliament, not without discovering in his speech visible marks of dissatisfaction. Even so early in his reign, he saw reason to make public complaints of the restless and encroaching spirit of the Puritanical party, and of the malevolence with which they endeavored to inspire the commons. Nor were his complaints without foundation, or the Puritans without interest; since the commons, now finding themselves free from the arbitrary government of Elizabeth, made application for a conference with the lords, and presented a petition to the king; the purport of both which was, to procure in favor of the Puritans, a relaxation of the ecclesiastical laws.[*] The use of the surplice, and of the cross in baptism is there chiefly complained of; but the remedy seems to have been expected solely from the king's dispensing power,[**] In the papers which contain this application and petition, we may also see proofs of the violent animosity of the commons against the Catholics, together with the intolerating spirit of that assembly.[***] 47

This summer, the peace with Spain was finally concluded, and was signed by the Spanish ministers at London.[****] In the conferences previous to this treaty, the nations were found to have so few claims on each other, that, except on account of the support given by England to the Low Country provinces, the war might appear to have been continued more on account of personal animosity between Philip and Elizabeth, than any contrariety of political interests between their subjects. Some articles in the treaty, which seemed prejudicial to the Dutch commonwealth, were never executed by the king; and as the Spaniards made no complaints on that head, it appeared that, by secret agreement, the king had expressly reserved the power of sending assistance to the Hollanders.[v] The constable of Castile came into England to ratify the peace; and on the part of England, the earl of Hertford was sent into the Low Countries for the same purpose, and the earl of Nottingham, high admiral, into Spain. The train of the latter was numerous and splendid; and the Spaniards, it is said, were extremely surprised when they beheld the blooming countenances and graceful appearance of the English, whom their bigotry, inflamed by the priests, had represented as so many monsters and infernal demons.

Though England, by means of her naval force, was perfectly secure during the latter years of the Spanish war, James showed an impatience to put an end to hostilities; and soon after his accession, before any terms of peace were concerted, or even proposed by Spain, he recalled all the letters of marque.

In this respect, James's peace was more honorable than that which Henry IV. himself made with Spain. This latter prince stipulated not to assist the Dutch; and the supplies which he secretly sent them were in direct contravention to the treaty.[*] which had been granted by Queen Elizabeth. Archduke Albert had made some advances of a like nature[**] which invited the king to take this friendly step. But what is remarkable, in James's proclamation for that purpose he plainly supposes, that as he had himself, while king of Scotland, always lived in amity with Spain, peace was attached to his person; and that merely by his accession to the crown of England, without any articles of treaty or agreement, he had ended the war between the kingdoms.[***] This ignorance of the law of nations may appear surprising in a prince who was thirty-six years of age, and who had reigned from his infancy; did we not consider that a king of Scotland, who lives in close friendship with England, has few transactions to manage with foreign princes, and has little opportunity of acquiring experience. Unhappily for James, his timidity, his prejudices, his indolence, his love of amusement, particularly of hunting, to which he was much addicted, ever prevented him from making any progress in the knowledge or practice of foreign politics, and in a little time diminished that regard which all the neighboring nations had paid to England during the reign of his predecessor.[****]

Footnotes:


44 :[ NOTE RR, p. 391. Sir Charles Cornwallis, the king's ambassador at Madrid, when pressed by the duke of Lernia to enter into a league with Spain, said to that minister, ""Though his majesty was an absolute king, and therefore not bound to give an account to any of his actions, yet that so gracious and regardful a prince he was of the love and contentment of his own subjects, as I assured myself he would not think it fit to do any thing of so great consequence without acquainting them with his intentions."" Winwood, vol. ii. p. 222. Sir Walter Raleigh has this passage in the preface to his History of the World: ""Philip II., by strong hand and main force, attempted to make himself not only an absolute monarch over the Netherlands, like unto the kings and monarchs of England and France, but, Turk like, to tread under his feet all their natural and fundamental laws, privileges, and ancient rights."" We meet with this passage in Sir John Davis's Question concerning impositions, (p. 161:) ""Thus we see, by this comparison, that the king of England doth lay but his little finger upon his subjects, when other princes and states do lay their heavy loins upon their people. What is the reason of this difference? from whence cometh it? assuredly not from a different power or prerogative; for the king of England is as absolute a monarch as any emperor or king in the world, and hath as many prerogatives incident to his crown."" Coke, in Cawdry's case, says, ""that by the ancient laws of this realm, England is an absolute empire and monarchy; and that the king is furnished with plenary and entire power, prerogative, and jurisdiction, and is supreme governor over all persons within this realm,'"" Spencer, speaking of some grants of the English kings to the Irish corporations, says, ""all which, though at the time of their first grant they were tolerable, and perhaps reasonable, yet now are most unreasonable and inconvenient. But all these will easily be cut off, with the superior power of her majesty's prerogative, against which her own grants are not to be pleaded or enforced."" State of Ireland p. 1637, edit. 1706. The same author, in p. 1660, proposes a plan for the civilization of Ireland; that the queen should create a marshal in every county, who might ride about with eight or ten followers in search of stragglers and vagabonds: the first time he catches any, he may punish them more lightly by the stocks; the second time, by whipping; but the third time, he may hang them, without trial or process, on the first bough: and he thinks that this authority may more safely be intrusted to the provost marshal than to the sheriff; because the latter magistrate, having a profit by the escheats of felons, may be tempted to hang innocent persons. Here a real absolute, or rather despotic power is pointed out; and we may infer from all these passages, either that the word absolute bore a different sense from what it does at present, or that men's ideas of the English, as well as Irish government, were then different. This latter inference seems juster. The word, being derived from the French, bore always the same sense as in that language. An absolute monarchy, in Charles I,'s answer to the nineteen propositions is opposed to a limited; and the king of England is acknowledged not to be absolute: so much had matters changed even before the civil war. In Sir John Fortescue's treatise of absolute and limited monarchy, a book written in the reign of Edward IV., the word absolute is taken in the same sense as at present; and the government of England is also said not to be absolute. They were the princes of the house of Tudor chiefly who introduced that administration which had the appearance of absolute government. The princes before them were restrained by the barons; as those after them by the house of commons. The people had, properly speaking, little liberty in either of these ancient governments, but least in the more ancient.]

45 (return):[ NOTE SS, p. 392. Even this parliament, which showed so much spirit and good sense in the affair of Goodwin, made a strange concession to the crown in their fourth session. Toby Mathews, a member, had been banished by order of the council, upon direction from his majesty. The parliament not only acquiesced in this arbitrary proceeding, but issued writs for a new election: such novices were they as yet in the principles of liberty. See Journ. 14th Feb. 1609. Mathews was banished by the king on account of his change of religion to Popery. The king had an indulgence to those who had been educated Catholics; but could not bear the new converts. It was probably the animosity of the commons against the Papists which made them acquiesce in this precedent, without reflecting on the consequences. The jealousy of liberty, though roused, was not yet thoroughly enlightened.]

46 :[ NOTE TT, p. 394. At that time, men of genius and of enlarged minds had adopted the principles of liberty, which were as yet pretty much unknown to the generality of the people. Sir Matthew Hales has published a remonstrance against the king's conduct towards the parliament during this session. The remonstrance is drawn with great force of reasoning and spirit of liberty; and was the production of Sir Francis Bacon and Sir Edwin Sandys, two men of the greatest parts and knowledge in England. It is drawn in the name of the commons; but as there is no hint of it in the journals, we must conclude, either that the authors, sensible that the strain of the piece was much beyond the principles of the age, had not ventured to present it to the house, or that it had been for that reason rejected. The dignity and authority of the commons are strongly insisted upon in this remonstrance; and it is there said, that their submission to the ill treatment which they received during the latter part of Elizabeth's reign, had proceeded from their tenderness towards her age and her sex. But the authors are mistaken in these facts: for the house received and submitted to as bad treatment in the beginning and middle of that reign. The government was equally arbitrary in Mary's reign, in Edward's, in Henry VIII. and VII.'s. And the further we go back into history, though there might be more of a certain irregular kind of liberty among the barons, the commons were still of less authority.]

47 :[ NOTE UU, p. 398. This parliament passed an act of recognition of the king's title in the most ample terms. They recognized and acknowledged, that immediately upon the dissolution and decease of Elizabeth, late queen of England, the imperial crown thereof did, by inherent birthright and lawful and undoubted succession, descend and come to his most excellent majesty, as being lineally, justly, and lawfully next and sole heir of the blood royal of this realm. I James I. cap. 1. The Puritans, though then prevalent, did not think proper to dispute this great constitutional point. In the recognition of Queen Elizabeth, the parliament declares, that the queen's highness is, and in very deed and of most mere right ought to be, by the laws of God and by the laws and statutes of this realm, our most lawful and rightful sovereign, liege lady, and queen, etc. It appears, then, that if King James's divine right be not mentioned by parliament, the omission came merely from chance, and because that phrase did not occur to the compiler of the recognition; his title being plainly the same with that of his predecessor, who was allowed to have a divine right.]",159049,en,en,en,

These veins are lagging, I must get up
No gains, abstaining, pray the rust lets up and

Trek the prep, I step outside
Screaming stride, like a phoenix flying
Am that I am, I'm so damn alive, I
Thrive on fire, grow wild inside, on
A lakewalk melee, summer to the autumn
Every day is leg day, running from my problems
Six years back, I was a fucking mess
Now that same fucking mess is archaic dress sense
Set fire to the past and leave, no desire to
Believe I'm the same brat I used to be
Prose became the flame, a volcano in my head
Explodes to the beat of my feet on the street ahead
Not seated til death, got an end to reach
Can't yet stay blessed on my own two feet

Aim, cuz I'm ready
Slash me through some fiction

So fuck money, sick of running for the green
I'm running for the scenery, not running for the scene
Need more tattoos, fewer bruises
Less bad news, I choose this movement, over
The toothless, teething on the roots of a tree
Leaf in the breeze, what's a human to do with this
Perfectionism? tryna rule these dreams
Dissecting 'em, clueless to what anything means
The anti-chase, I found myself running
Further and further away from something
Old hurt, a someone, maybe in retrospect, it
Could be the truth is I move cuz I'm meant to
Fate tempts me, empty lungs and out of breath
Can I trust to be the one who outruns the rest?
No outcome with rest, feel the pulse on my wrist
Reroute, wide eyes, making sure I exist
Embraced the aloneness, once I'm feeling how
The race gives us wholeness, I'm done with stealing out

Method that will let rise the hive with a flex
Won't taste the curb yet, my stinger's gonna bring it to a-
Nother level 'less the shovel digs the tunnel big enough to
Fit the trail of dead, the offense, ready

Monna Innominata,misc,Christina Rossetti,1906,2094,{},"Beatrice, immortalized by ""altissimo poeta ... cotanto
amante;"" Laura, celebrated by a great though an inferior bard,--have
alike paid the exceptional penalty of exceptional honor,
and have come down to us resplendent with charms, but (at
least, to my apprehension) scant of attractiveness.

These heroines of world-wide fame were preceded by a bevy
of unnamed ladies ""donne innominate"" sung by a school of
less conspicuous poets; and in that land and that period which
gave simultaneous birth to Catholics, to Albigenses, and to
Troubadours, one can imagine many a lady as sharing her
lover's poetic aptitude, while the barrier between them might
be one held sacred by both, yet not such as to render mutual
love incompatible with mutual honor.

Had such a lady spoken for herself, the portrait left us might
have appeared more tender, if less dignified, than any drawn
even by a devoted friend. Or had the Great Poetess of our
own day and nation only been unhappy instead of happy, her
circumstances would have invited her to bequeath to us, in
lieu of the ""Portuguese Sonnets,"" an inimitable ""donna innominata""
drawn not from fancy but from feeling, and worthy
to occupy a niche beside Beatrice and Laura.
                                1.

""Lo di che han detto a' dolci amici addio.""--Dante.
""Amor, con quanto sforzo oggi mi vinci!""--Petrarca.

Come back to me, who wait and watch for you:--
        Or come not yet, for it is over then,
        And long it is before you come again,
So far between my pleasures are and few.
While, when you come not, what I do I do
        Thinking ""Now when he comes,"" my sweetest ""when:""
        For one man is my world of all the men
This wide world holds; O love, my world is you.
Howbeit, to meet you grows almost a pang
        Because the pang of parting comes so soon;
        My hope hangs waning, waxing, like a moon
                Between the heavenly days on which we meet:
Ah me, but where are now the songs I sang
                When life was sweet because you called them sweet?

                                2.

""Era già l'ora che volge il desio.""--Dante.
""Ricorro al tempo ch' io vi vidi prima.""--Petrarca.

I wish I could remember that first day,
        First hour, first moment of your meeting me,
        If bright or dim the season, it might be
Summer or Winter for aught I can say;
So unrecorded did it slip away,
        So blind was I to see and to foresee,
        So dull to mark the budding of my tree
That would not blossom yet for many a May.
If only I could recollect it, such
        A day of days! I let it come and go
        As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow;
It seemed to mean so little, meant so much;
If only now I could recall that touch,
        First touch of hand in hand--Did one but know!
                                3.

""O ombre vane, fuor che ne l'aspetto!""--Dante.
""Immaginata guida la conduce.""--Petrarca.

I dream of you to wake: would that I might
        Dream of you and not wake but slumber on;
        Nor find with dreams the dear companion gone,
As Summer ended Summer birds take flight.
In happy dreams I hold you full in sight,
        I blush again who waking look so wan;
        Brighter than sunniest day that ever shone,
In happy dreams your smile makes day of night.
Thus only in a dream we are at one,
        Thus only in a dream we give and take
                The faith that maketh rich who take or give;
        If thus to sleep is sweeter than to wake,
                To die were surely sweeter than to live,
Though there be nothing new beneath the sun.

                                4.

""Poca favilla gran fiamma seconda.""--Dante.
""Ogni altra cosa, ogni pensier va fore,
E sol ivi con voi rimansi amore.""--Petrarca.
I loved you first: but afterwards your love
        Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song
As drowned the friendly cooings of my dove.
        Which owes the other most? my love was long,
        And yours one moment seemed to wax more strong;
I loved and guessed at you, you construed me
And loved me for what might or might not be--
        Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.
For verily love knows not ""mine"" or ""thine;""
        With separate ""I"" and ""thou"" free love has done,
                For one is both and both are one in love:
Rich love knows nought of ""thine that is not mine;""
                Both have the strength and both the length thereof,
        Both of us of the love which makes us one.

                                        5.

""Amor che a nulla amato amar perdona.""--Dante.
""Amor m'addusse in si gioiosa spene.""--Petrarca.

O my heart's heart, and you who are to me
        More than myself myself, God be with you,
        Keep you in strong obedience leal and true
To Him whose noble service setteth free,
Give you all good we see or can foresee,
        Make your joys many and your sorrows few,
        Bless you in what you bear and what you do,
Yea, perfect you as He would have you be.
So much for you; but what for me, dear friend?
        To love you without stint and all I can
To-day, to-morrow, world without an end;
                To love you much and yet to love you more,
                As Jordan at his flood sweeps either shore;
        Since woman is the helpmeet made for man.

                                6.

                                ""Or puoi la quantitate
Comprender de l'amor che a te mi scalda.""--Dante.
""Non vo' che da tal nodo amor mi scioglia.""--Petrarca.

Trust me, I have not earned your dear rebuke,
        I love, as you would have me, God the most;
        Would lose not Him, but you, must one be lost,
Nor with Lot's wife cast back a faithless look
Unready to forego what I forsook;
        This say I, having counted up the cost,
        This, though I be the feeblest of God's host,
The sorriest sheep Christ shepherds with His crook,
Yet while I love my God the most, I deem
        That I can never love you overmuch;
                I love Him more, so let me love you too;
        Yea, as I apprehend it, love is such
I cannot love you if I love not Him,
        I cannot love Him if I love not you.

                                7.

""Qui primavera sempre ed ogni frutto.""--Dante.
""Ragionando con meco ed io con lui.""--Petrarca.

""Love me, for I love you""--and answer me,
        ""Love me, for I love you""--so shall we stand
        As happy equals in the flowering land
Of love, that knows not a dividing sea.
Love builds the house on rock and not on sand,
        Love laughs what while the winds rave desperately;
And who hath found love's citadel unmanned?
        And who hath held in bonds love's liberty?
My heart's a coward though my words are brave--
        We meet so seldom, yet we surely part
        So often; there's a problem for your art!
                Still I find comfort in his Book, who saith,
Though jealousy be cruel as the grave,
        And death be strong, yet love is strong as death.

                                8.

""Come dicesse a Dio: D'altro non calme.""--Dante.
""Spero trovar pietà non che perdono.""--Petrarca.

""I, if I perish, perish""--Esther spake:
        And bride of life or death she made her fair
        In all the lustre of her perfumed hair
And smiles that kindle longing but to slake.
She put on pomp of loveliness, to take
        Her husband through his eyes at unaware;
        She spread abroad her beauty for a snare,
Harmless as doves and subtle as a snake.
She trapped him with one mesh of silken hair,
        She vanquished him by wisdom of her wit,
                And built her people's house that it should stand:--
                If I might take my life so in my hand,
And for my love to Love put up my prayer,
        And for love's sake by Love be granted it!

                                9.

""O dignitosa coscienza e netta!""--Dante.
""Spirto più acceso di virtuti ardenti.""--Petrarca.

Thinking of you, and all that was, and all
        That might have been and now can never be,
        I feel your honored excellence, and see
Myself unworthy of the happier call:
For woe is me who walk so apt to fall,
        So apt to shrink afraid, so apt to flee,
        Apt to lie down and die (ah, woe is me!)
Faithless and hopeless turning to the wall.
And yet not hopeless quite nor faithless quite,
Because not loveless; love may toil all night,
        But take at morning; wrestle till the break
                Of day, but then wield power with God and man:--
                So take I heart of grace as best I can,
        Ready to spend and be spent for your sake.

                                10.

""Con miglior corso e con migliore stella.""--Dante.
""La vita fugge e non s'arresta un' ora.""--Petrarca.

Time flies, hope flags, life plies a wearied wing;
        Death following hard on life gains ground apace;
        Faith runs with each and rears an eager face,
Outruns the rest, makes light of everything,
Spurns earth, and still finds breath to pray and sing;
        While love ahead of all uplifts his praise,
        Still asks for grace and still gives thanks for grace,
Content with all day brings and night will bring.
Life wanes; and when love folds his wings above
        Tired hope, and less we feel his conscious pulse,
                Let us go fall asleep, dear friend, in peace:
                A little while, and age and sorrow cease;
        A little while, and life reborn annuls
Loss and decay and death, and all is love.

                                11.

""Vien dietro a me e lascia dir le genti.""--Dante.
""Contando i casi della vita nostra.""--Petrarca.

Many in aftertimes will say of you
""He loved her""--while of me what will they say?
        Not that I loved you more than just in play,
For fashion's sake as idle women do.
Even let them prate; who know not what we knew
        Of love and parting in exceeding pain,
        Of parting hopeless here to meet again,
Hopeless on earth, and heaven is out of view.
But by my heart of love laid bare to you,
        My love that you can make not void nor vain,
Love that foregoes you but to claim anew
                Beyond this passage of the gate of death,
        I charge you at the Judgment make it plain
                My love of you was life and not a breath.

                12.

""Amor, che ne la mente mi ragiona.""--Dante.
""Amor vien nel bel viso di costei.""--Petrarca.

If there be any one can take my place
        And make you happy whom I grieve to grieve,
        Think not that I can grudge it, but believe
I do commend you to that nobler grace,
That readier wit than mine, that sweeter face;
        Yea, since your riches make me rich, conceive
        I too am crowned, while bridal crowns I weave,
And thread the bridal dance with jocund pace.
For if I did not love you, it might be
        That I should grudge you some one dear delight;
                But since the heart is yours that was mine own,
        Your pleasure is my pleasure, right my right,
Your honorable freedom makes me free,
                And you companioned I am not alone.

                                13.

""E drizzeremo gli occhi al Primo Amore.""--Dante.
""Ma trovo peso non da le mie braccia.""--Petrarca.

If I could trust mine own self with your fate,
        Shall I not rather trust it in God's hand?
        Without Whose Will one lily doth not stand,
Nor sparrow fall at his appointed date;
        Who numbereth the innumerable sand,
Who weighs the wind and water with a weight,
To Whom the world is neither small nor great,
        Whose knowledge foreknew every plan we planned.
Searching my heart for all that touches you,
        I find there only love and love's goodwill
Helpless to help and impotent to do,
                Of understanding dull, of sight most dim;
                And therefore I commend you back to Him
        Whose love your love's capacity can fill.

                                14.

""E la Sua Volontade è nostra pace.""--Dante.
""Sol con questi pensier, con altre chiome.""--Petrarca.

Youth gone, and beauty gone if ever there
        Dwelt beauty in so poor a face as this;
        Youth gone and beauty, what remains of bliss?
I will not bind fresh roses in my hair,
To shame a cheek at best but little fair,--
        Leave youth his roses, who can bear a thorn,--
I will not seek for blossoms anywhere,
        Except such common flowers as blow with corn.
Youth gone and beauty gone, what doth remain?
        The longing of a heart pent up forlorn,
                A silent heart whose silence loves and longs;
                The silence of a heart which sang its songs
        While youth and beauty made a summer morn,
Silence of love that cannot sing again.",148681,en,en,en,

Aye it’s Lil Lupus

[Verse 1: Kenny Golder Jr.]
From the Phe to the M.A.C
Summertime Shine, are we finna hit the beach
Find a dime, waste alot of time or just go sleep?
In attempt to keep the peace of mind, it ain’t that deep
Asking Z how to spend my time

[Verse 2: Z. Lew]
Maybe you’ll drive till the night ends
Maybe you’ll chill with your bae
Maybe you’ll take her out of state
Sometimes it’s okay to be cliché

[Verse 3: Kenny Golder Jr.]
Clichés can be the best way (way)
We stay up all night and party all day (all day)
I met this one girl, bright as a sun ray (sun ray)
If you see her walk by just send her my way (my way)
[Verse 4: Z. Lew]
Look, T.L.C, T.L.C, T.L.C (T.L.C)
Give her that love that will make her stay a week (stay a week)
Hands on her waist when your loving her physique
Let her talk slow she’s the only one you need

[Verse 5: Kenny Golder Jr. & Z. Lew]
In Summer nights she the only one I see
Catching a vibe while your chilling on the beach
Feet in the sand and she’s like the ocean breeze
She got the soul that’ll make you feel complete

[Chorus: Alex Marie Brinkley]
Living like we own it
We just want to show it
Feeling like we’re in a dream
Guess we’ve always known it
Pick it up and go and
Feeling like we’re finally free
We just want to make it
Know that we can take it
What they thought we’d never see
Every word we’re saying
Never see us breaking
I know we would be forever you and me
[Verse 6: Z. Lew]
I just need to get away from (away from)
Everything holding me down, and then some (and then some)
I think its time for a youngin just to have fun (just to have fun)
I think its time for a youngin just to fall in love (in love)

Worked so hard for this moment (moment)
Keeping God first I condone it (done it)
Sending prayers up I been on it (I been on)
Now I’m balling out cause I’m chosen (I’m chosen)

[Verse 7: Kenny Golder Jr.]
Chosen one tryna have a little fun (little fun)
And you bathing in the riches adding in a little sun (little sun)
And you there whenever I need you
So you can count on me like 3 2 1

Living in the moment when I’m with my girl or with my crew (crew)

Summer heat? When we meet? Something we won’t lose (won’t lose)
Oooo
When Im looking at you (at you)
Hope you smiling right back, Goldfish in the blue
You going looney to my tunes, but that ain’t all folks
It’s the Sumner in you ain’t gotta peel to see the yolk (see the yolk)

Loving this life, I can’t believe that I’m here (believe that I’m here)
Now I’m at the top and I see everything clear (see everything clear)

Got my heartbeat on the run
Not the same as anyone

Lure me in to stay a while
Tangled in your poison smile

There is no music
There is no sunlight
The world is gray
Away from you
The clocks are frozen
And time's a traveller
Who's lost his way

The people I meet
Might as well be statues
The words we exchange
Might as well be Greek
The room that I'm in
May be bright and cheerful
But to me
It's dim and bleak

I'm half alive
Until the moment
The door swings open
And you walk through
Now my world starts to glow
Like a stained-glass window
And what was old and cold
Is warm and new
And so you see
Why I can never be
Away from you
Away from you
The world is lifeless
As though creation
Has gone awry
The trees are bare
There are no flowers
The fields are thirsty
The streams are dry

We live, you and I
For a breath of sunlight
So brief an escape
From a world of gray
Our moments of warmth
Have been touch and go, love
But tonight, we'll touch
And stay

The people I meet
Might as well be statues
The words we exchange
Might as well be Greek
The room that I'm in
May be bright and cheerful
But to me
It's dim and bleak
I'm half alive
Until the moment
The door swings open

On a wave of music

Hold on I need a second to think

Such a new thing flowing through my fingers
I'm gonna run them through your hair, hit the spots you don't know are there
Feel your vibrations

And I'll see you in my dreams
That is even if you let me sleep

Welcome to, welcome to my headspace
Don't know what you'll find, I've never seen you before
I hear you knocking, knocking on my door
I hear you knocking, knocking on my door

Your lips are so soft, to the touch
That's why I bite them, so I don't ignite
Now tell me, how did you get into my head?

I think I must've thought you up
Or maybe you fell down from space
Either way, I know that I let you in...wait what?

If I went broke it still be all good
Cuz I got a fix for getting it right back ha

I'm like professor x and magneto
My thoughts deep and my swag lethal
I attract the cash bad divas with ass
If you hatin it's sad and you mad see thru
Mad people be mad people
Live backwards me I see past evil
Tryna spread my wings across the desert land
And would really hate to have to blast eagle
Can't let niggas from the past leech you
Shorty talkin bout when I last seent
You you was in ya bag lookin like a snack
Bet you draw that money with a math easel
Get it now no waits for what
Only gettin harder for us black people
It's like I get my weight On a Freight truck
Cuz it don't make no sense how my gas diesel
Champagne glasses with vueve clique man who would think
We come this far tryna wash my sins
Now In these fresh Lauren's I'm a walkin saint
Oh my God this song is hard
I can see me now heading to the bank
Focused up so the business straight
More plates than your kitchen sink
Got the kitchen stank
The only real mission is get it
Success accomplish ya goals
My passion ull make you look at life different
Cause fatal attraction in hoes

Took off and landed in dough

Smoking back to back in the back of the back
Blowin stacks on saks I'm all for
I'm self made and I organize if you build it strong it Won't fall From the boogie down to world tours
Stamped this a sample raw they want more
Make withdrawals then I cash out
She wanna smoke and fuck Til we pass out
I gravitate back to the cash route
I see what these mad rappers mad bout
They heard my shit now they dreams filled wit mad doubt
Man down
Like a stripper on a pole guess you assed out
Bankrolls in the machine  love the cash sound
If I was mcdonalds u mcdowells whoa

Set off on the left, led him sevens and call free
Effort with an “E” and beleaguered and drawn to

Log flume barking and back in your court mad
Like where'd you get that start or a heart to record that
Harvest the porn mags, and use it to lose face
A hundred in his wallet and one in his suitcase
Roof raid missing the porkage of bread ruin
Riffing when they shouldn't and horny as hell's coos
Order me Yelp soup like I'm high as Christmas
But then I take it back like a fly was in it
Driver hit it, here's a couple of karats/carrots
Because when Smits making dollars he don't want it to perish
Up in the air, is it a bird, a brick
No I heard he just been rolling like he Eartha Kitt
Worth a lick but just feeling a good grief
I know how many O's are in the middle of Tootsie
Could be crazy and I could be on
To something when I said you shouldn't push me wrong
Hoof feet fond in the face of danger
Yogi with a trophy mount made for ranger
See if six was a nine it wouldn't be a six

Zipper neck fleece, brain of a sawhorse
Flesh reanimated, remains of a small war
Painted the drawn sword to match with the straw hat
All leather, rubber, and covered in gauze pads
Cupboards of cloth rags and bottles of Pomade
Zippo in the monogram motto that mom made
Shop 'Til You Drop weight then guess within five pounds
To win a promo photo with Bozo the Clown's mouth
Opening downtown, near Joe's on the west side
A so perverted junkie with nowhere to get high
Oceans of neck ties meets the River Phoenix
Before he got killed breaking up some beef shit
Stuff the sheets with green for funding
A little league team full of thieves for cufflinks
Keep on shoving and it won't be long
Till you find out why I said you shouldn't push me wrong
Cook meatballs with the bread defloured
Sweating like a rent-a-cop at Eddie Bauer

He kicked you out by the side of the road
All alone in the dead of the night
You were scared and chilled to the bone
When I saw you in my headlights
Rain pouring down, you soaked to the skin
Pleading with me to take you in
Couldn't drive on and leave you alone
In there in the dead of the night
Alone in the dead of the night

[Verse 2]
I took you home and dried your clothes
Found out about the shape you were in
Heard your story and all your worry
You could never go back again
I held you close all through the night
And everything changed with the morning light
(I) didn't think we would both be alone
If I'd taken that other road home
If I'd taken that other road home

But I listen to that silent voice
Stopping me cold like I had no choice
Doing what I could for someone else
Didn't know I was saving myself
Didn't know I was saving myself

I'd find my redemption in you
So much more than circumstance
I knew what I had to do

Devoid of doubt in stereo

32 Degrees Ninety Remix,rap,The Black Ace,2018,261,{},"(Chorus)
I need degrees
The heat and the knowledge I gain from this piece
Of a part of my life, putting my pain at ease
Waking up early to go back to sleep
Staying up late just to find me some peace
Don't know why I'm so cold
Need more warmth in my soul
I'm below
32 Degrees

(1st Degree)
Leaping towards faith as I'm falling in black
Vision is blurry, need new cataracts
Speaking in tongues but I translate to facts
Writing these stories I turn into raps and songs and things that ring inside of my head
I'd rather feel all this then act like I'm dead
A moment's decision can have you straight wishing you're dead
Choking up when I...speak
On things that I should've said
Got too much time to...think
About the time that I've spent
Pushing myself until I am the best
Version of me and that's with no contest
Telling lies to myself but I'm honest
I need to stop this (I really need to stop this)
When I'm alone back at home
Spitting rhymes from the dome
It reminds me of times when I'd grab my phone
And I never saw a thing, just surfed on the web
Those times came in waves, they'd flow and they'd ebb
But nothing could stop me, took hits like I'm Rocky
'cause this match ain't over 'till I run out of breathe
And even then I'll live forever in the center of your chest

(Chorus)

(2nd Verse)
I feel pain (so cold)
Then not a thing (so cold)
Everything that I think, I just feel like it's hard to explain (hard to explain)
I'm not used to this unless I write it down
I'm like a king taking care of his crown
There's only a few who can touch it if I let 'em
My hopes are so high, watch me go get 'em
But as you climb up, temperature drops low
Your blood turns cold and your heart beats slow
And you reach this place you never wanted to be
Like a dog in a pound or a cat in a tree
I can't get out, but I'm gon shout
I need some help until I'm found
I'm by myself, that's all that counts
(Chorus)

(3rd Verse)
My life is a sea
So i'm riding the waves of these beats, can't explain what it means
To me there is a secrecy hidden from self
And I don't know why but I'm afraid for my health

Consumed,rap,Fiphel,2014,57,{},"[Verse 1: Fiphel]
Now a lot of you are probably wondering where I am
Just know I wasn’t kidnapped, this ain’t some sort of scam
First of all I miss you, this may seem sort of wrong
But I hope that most of you don’t even notice that I’m gone
I don’t want a single person shedding any tears
Just go on with life, like I was never here
You never even met me, so I never caused you harm
I never made you cry, and you never slit your arm
And instead of me you met a handsome loving guy
Who did all the things for you that I could only try
He made all of you happy, he never told a lie
He never left your side, when you just wanted to die
He never got annoyed at you, even deep inside
He knew what to do, at any place, any time
He even explained to you the how and the why
And you could clearly see God in his eyes
I hope that God replaces me, with that sort of friend
Who’s there for the women and a leader for the men
Enjoy life while you can before it ends
Don’t remember me or even think of me again
[Verse 2: Fiphel]
So back to what happened, and why I’m not around
And why there isn’t any body to put in the ground
Here’s a little story, so you can understand
Who, what, when, why, and where I am
Those last few months I was constantly writing
That’s why we didn’t speak much after that one night when
I irritated you again, with all of my questions
I just wanted to help, guess I should have learned my lesson
Regardless, my shrink says I fell back into depression
I think my cynicism may have gave her that impression
But I was just fine, maybe I stopped caring
About my words and actions, or what I was wearing
But I was spitting rhymes like never before
Complicated cadences with clever retorts
Some of it was serious, some of it was weird
But it was all a waste, ‘cause one day I disappeared
The cops told my parents I probably ran away
But everyone who knew me knew that there was just no way
At first no one at school noticed I was missing
But no one even cared so nobody would listen
It’s only been a week, already I’m a joke
Told behind the backs of those, who would choke
The life out of anyone who mocked my departure
If you only knew me, maybe laughing would be harder
”We’ve all had chances, now they’ve all vanished”
I think, as I dangle from this bridge, in a panic
As I strain against the frigid chains
Trying not to let the pain take over my brain
The lighter fluid’s vile and nauseating scent
Sends chills through me, makes my gut clench
I scream past my instinct for self defense
Flick the lighter on, suddenly the stench
Of my own burning flesh shatters my resolve
As I fall I unleash a dying desperate call
Nobody can hear my cry except for God
And I already told Him that this death is what I want
I’m truly alone and with my dying breath
I apologize for being such a nervous wreck
My personality is only one of my regrets
I dedicate to rap all that I have left
[Verse 3: Fiphel]
The raging sensation in my muscles was replaced
By a frigid wind that ate away at my face
I tried to look up, realized I was blind
I felt an all too familiar presence in my mind
He spoke to me, he said “Welcome to my home
There’s millions here with you, everyday we’re growing”
I replied “Others? Then how come I’m alone?”
He chuckled to himself and he handed me a phone
I couldn’t sense his presence anymore but I knew
He was watching me, he wanted to see what I would do
I was betting he would only give me one call
So I dialed home and left this message for you all
Just so you would know, that I chose this for myself
I sold my soul to rap, it’s too late for you to help
Just burn all of our memories, it’s time to say farewell
And I pray that when you see me next, YOU won’t be in hell…

What are you doing bro? It's pretty low

Trynna find a way to lay low, stop trynna get my head high
I'm just trying to get high, I know what to say bye

And my show so she goes in the smooth sailing

Gotta get back to Los Angeles

On the road to the old
Castle of my calm, of my dreams
My new home

And shows the dark windows nearly

Stepping into my room
I'm welcomed by light
And the picture on my wall
Silently ways good night

I wake up with the sun
But I'm really not the one
The paiting with the balcony
Seems to move like the dawn
I break away from the mistery
But to visit the garden
And see my magnetic balcony
Understand what happens
Running back to the picture
Looking night and day
Madness and reality
Fighting in my brain
And the picture slowly shows itself
Painted figures with painted selves
A girl in the dark every night
Waiting fro the torture: the killer's knife

Bloody eyes try to find the way
Trembling hands try to find the key
Blood, wash the torture...
Blood, break the curse...
In the dark - in the night
With the knife - in my heart...",1275265,en,en,en,

Half expecting to catch a sight
Of the dead Russian soldiers marching into the night

As the dawn rubs up against our aching head

Of broken bags and dreams by Turkish cafes
Where the dirty little pigeon played his inner puddle
By the drip drip drip of an emptying bottle
Of champagne perched on top of a half bombed church
Seeing angels who hear our wounds that make no sounds
The bird flies out to meet the hopes of the dreamers
And see what such grand stories

He tries so hard
But falls back to earth to the filth of the yard

From sunrise to moonlight, no one to be found
Girl, I'm ready for your love when you're fearless, right
I can feel your energy even though you're not mine

[Chorus]
Somethin bout the way that you looked at me, I just can't explain
All is I keep listening but I don't hear a thing
I just can't stop thinkin bout you day by day
Eyes wide, not blinking cause I feel you closing in
I feel you closing in

[Verse 2]
Feel you closing in, something in the wind, I can feel your energy
So close, but so far, feels like you're playing games with me
I'm lovin without touching, girl I'm going crazy
I'm dreamin about lovin, and what you're gonna do to me
Yeah, and what you're gonna do to me
And what you'rе gonna do to me
Why do you have to hide, do you know what for
Is it you or is it mе in this empty world
All the times I call your name, but you don't come forth
I can feel your energy even though you're not mine

[Chorus]
Somethin bout the way that you looked at me, I just can't explain
All is I keep listening but I don't hear a thing

One fucking question: tell me, where my Juggalos at
This life is a blessing thank God that I chose rap
Wicked clowns in your town know that the shows packed
Down 'til I'm in the ground everybody knows that
Fill 'em when I get it so you better get the medic
I'm about to blow motherfuckers wig back - dig that
Breaking ya bones like a twig- crack
Put it in the box like a Big Mac run and tell the pigs that
I said ""Fuck the police til I'm dead!""
At least I'm a beast in my head
I'm violent 'cause a riot, now bye Fed!
I'm all in you, fallin' and ballin' like west group
Really never had money, never got a checkbook
Stress took away 'cause I got it down dead rook
Know that I'm fresh loose, leavin' the rest shook
Higher and higher and this flow she die for
And I know this hydro that I blow is fire
Just like a pyro, so check out my bio
I'm horned like a rhino and women admire
Young lizzle, hotter than the sun sizzle
'Bout to do my thug dizzle, 'bout to blow up like scud missle
Psychopathic hearthrob heart guy- I could make a tongue drizzle
Thats official. Professional juggalo prolo
Fuck on my team, that's a no-no
Respect that logo
This show, ho, what I stand fo'
Psychopathic Records my fam-o
Better watch, I'm about to eat ammo
Cause I am the Juggalo Rambo
Underground down, like a manhole
The mainstream cannot handle
I got shit for brains, I'm switching lanes
With the hatchet man sticker on that Lambo
Goin' HAM, bro, party 'til the bar closed
Car loads of hoes get swiped like barcodes
Bottle full of narcos up on the ceiling at Harpos
Only at our shows
I'm a rockstar slash monstar
I know I'm goin' fuckin' high star
I got a show to wreck, psychopathic soul to check
Your city I'ma bop hard
Then I stun a motherfucker, you ain't even gotta wonder
I'mma hit you with that thunder, I'm Godzilla!
Fuck you, my squad reala
Deep past that mob killa
Voodoo, Clay, Shaggs, J, Lyte and that ninja Ouija
Its all over, never weepy
Say at the door when you see me
Fuck the TV, the radio, this only for a select few
The only way I'll ever bury this hatchet is deep in your neck when I end you
[Verse 2: Violent J]
Throw up your sign, blow up your nine
Paw, pap, click, pop!
Skull, cap, spit, slop!
Fall back, click, chop!
All that, slick, hot!
Draw, gat, kick, drop!
Jaw, jack, get shot!
Sword play and quick stomp!
It seems the demon lives deep inside of me
Crying, it's dyin' to kill, kill, kill
Deep in my heart, it's the oddity part
Please, slaughter me, I'm promising I'd oughta be killed
Throbbing, my arteries, always it startles me
Sure to bring murder and kill, kill, kill
Gotta be outta me, shock or lobotomy!
I can't take this out of me, I wanna be killed
What's Juggalo love if you're not a Juggalo
And you got a lotta bullshit, a whole lotta ho shit
Nobody know that ya owe shit
On a whole lotta old shit, got a whole lot of bullshit
Kinda wanna throw shit, kinda wanna throat slit
Kinda wanna go get a four fifth and hold it
Load it, run up in sauna and explode it
Down the road into a Benihana and unload it
*Gunshot* Oh shit, you so lit
Blow shit in half and laugh, they don't know shit
Smoke shit, go kid, full clip
Wall of glass, you broke it, dope shit
Hocus pocus, need to focus
Though, don't blow this please
Triggers squeezing, chokin'
On these enemies croaking, bleeding, soaking
Greedy wipe up, weedy tokin'
Screaming ""heed the viper!""
In deep, preoccupied and hyper
Need it but fails, scope in a sniper
Who proceeded to open fire, BLAOW!
Now he need a diaper
We bleed for the fam, ain't right for you
[?] Psypher do
We fat chicks, hicks, black dicks, clits
Psychics, bikers, dykers, fags
Slackers, crackers, junkies, druggies
Thugs, scrubs, rubber necks and hags
Slugs, hackers, bums, lackers
Winners, sinners, tweekers, drag queens
Richies, bitches, geezers, kiddies
Jerks, experts, fats flirts and gypsies
With ADD, HIV, Hep C
Epilepsy, asthma, stress and zits
Arthritis, meningitis
Crones, herpes, scabies and bitch tits
We movers, shakers, plumbers, painters
Undertakers, pizza makers
Lumberjacks, nuns for crack
Some get slapped and stumble back!
But we real to each other, bust 'em up, bust 'em up
Slug 'em up, slug 'em up, buck 'em up, buck 'em up
And we die for each other, gag 'em up, gag 'em up
Slug 'em up, slug 'em up, bag 'em up, bag 'em up
Ride 'em out, ride 'em out, take 'em out, take 'em out
Drag 'em out, drag 'em out, break it out, break it out
Chop it up, chop it up, risk stacks
Lop it up, drop it in fish snacks
[Verse 3: Big Hoodoo]
My flows paint a portrait
Vividly, heaven's gate
My homeboys is insane
Literally Leather Face
I spit pure cocaine
Let it mentally resonate
It starts to sink in
Watch you physically levitate
Juggalo love and it's universal
My style's authentic and my words are hurtful
Truth when I give it, no gimmick, raw with it
All in it, y'all get it real fucking with the famo
Kush, cocaine, and gang load of ammo
Is all I keep on me, please don't sleep on me
Underground overlord, combat is my sport
Front line in a war, they ain't really ready for it
I'm rolling deep with fam
Loadin' up the yeapa
Niggas curl up when the Reaper comes
Start yellin' like Chewbacca
Hoodoo suited up and dressed to kill
I ain't nothing but a mobster
I go hard for the Juggalo nation
Spit in a face if anybody wanna say somethin' otherwise
Ride high when I fly by with my guys
All to so hell 'boutta break loose
Show you how to make moves like a double O G
From the hood, low key
Everybody know me I've been getting my grind on
Detroit had my back way before I signed on
I've got the whole city down ready to ride on
With Juggalo love everybody can vibe on (Vibe on)
[Verse 4: Shaggy 2 Dope]
It's Juggalo love 'cause that shit lasts
Every other love was shut off
Disagree? Fuck your bitch ass
You can fuck the fucking fuck the fuck off
You lick balls and your kid's soft
I'll sock your whole head bald, wig off
Rock your lid off, get hip tossed
Get lost and get kicked in your lip gloss
I ticked off a hick named Hoss that I ripped off
My bitch-made boss to the quick wash
The dick payed raw, so I lipped off
Switchblade to his jaw, made his shit fall
Quick, I dipped in his whip and zipped off
I kick balls and slit pussy lip walls
You told me to get lost, 'cause I get sauce
And fucked this girl in the butt 'til my dick soft
She like dick sauce, her clit's soft, man
So she get tossed, then shit can
Tried to beat it up and lost, the chick boss
Left in my drawers backwards, criss cross
(Jump!) Get the wig wash, to a stick gloss
Dope, black, fat, Rick Ross
My shit swass, big costs
So cold [?] my shit frosts
Straight to the chop chop, nope, never got pop
Juggalo love, move anything you got, hot
My brother Tre Lb we down, he'd clown
Always gonna be around, D town beat down
Juggalo love any time you hear the beat pound
Every day we put our feet down to the street sound
From Guantanamo Bay to Greek town
It's Juggalo love, but I won't turn your freak down

""And now, ladies and gentlemen, from the label that runs beneath the streets, we present to you, the latest and greatest hatchet man, from the trash fires of Detroit, Murderous, by way of Sin City, Las Vegas, Ouija""

[Verse 5: Ouija Macc]
Ay, hold up
Coming up in the bitch swangin'
Leaving ya fucking head rangin'
Hey wait, Hatchet man hangin'
All on my neck and that motherfucker blangin'
Pull up or shut the fuck up 'cause you know that you busters ain't finna do nothing
Couple of holes in your face and I'm lighting your fuckin' ass up like a pumpkin
Technically, that is a vegetable, now you are no longer able to function
Kicking that baby spit I wonder who dick you been sucking
Thinking it's gravy bitch I got that biscuit and I'm dumping (Boom)
Bunch of killers in the function
Pile of haters in the dungeon
Holy shit we 'bout to crush em'
You fucking stupid if you thought we wasn't
Lyte with me bout to rush em'
Kill em' all end of discussion
Suckers claiming what they ain't
Leave em' dripping like some paint
I ain't even gotta rap
I was waiting for the shank
Taking wicked shit back
Y'all been making that shit fake
Sneak dissing little bitches
We ain't nibblin' the bait
Pop off and get knocked off ya nose chopped off of yo face
Hop off in that moth coffin, your broad offer me brace
Who in the fuck did you thought it was
Living embodiment of every murderer
Ouija the goblin the demon the gurgler
Thought they were burglar they never heard of a
Creature like me I'm unheard of
Jump on a track like a hurdler
Foreign bitch in a chopper
Sin city baby burn it up
They found a third of the bitch that I killed in the woods
But they never discovered the cabin
I got your bitch in the cabin
She off a bean and she laughing
Next day you blowing my phone up
Asking me what the fuck happened
Sorry fell off of the wagon
Right into the medicine cabinet
Comet with a come up bullshit but I'm crushing every fuckin' thing in front of me
My moment has arrived
Duck and I slide
Juggalo love on my side
That shit ain't ever gon' die
Run up on me and my posse we gon' see
What's poppin' when I let my chopper decide
Bullets collide
Crumble your skeleton, blood into gelatin
Who wanna die
Better hope all y'all hear this shit
Ouija Macc came here to peel this shit
Never been shot but I drilled this shit
Zipped the body bag up when I kill this shit
For the knockoff brand trying to steal that shit
For the mainstream trying to conceal that shit
Frontin' on me you a stale ass bitch
You gonna ask yourself why you did that shit
No implants this some real ass shit
Whole cup of game, bout to spill this shit
People in the back won't miss this shit
Like the blind do braille you can feel this shit
Sure need some barbed-wire to rip this shit
Fatality mode let me finish it
Never forget who the family is
And the place you discovered the wicked shit

[Outro: Everyone, Violent J, Big Hoodoo]
I just wanna celebrate ('Cause Juggalos don't die!)
I just wanna celebrate (Cause we seventeenin'!)
I just wanna celebrate ('Cause Juggalos don't die!)
I just wanna celebrate (Yeah, motherfucker!)

I love that you've been there for me
My baby, it's like you get who I am
Waiting for the green light to get by

Let me try and charm her with my baritone
I got the barman doing numbers call it barcode
From a distance Dj playing with the echo
I see her dancing to the song feeling vibrant
She saw am into her damn I couldn't  hide that
But am way too shy to go and try to greet her
She broke the stare after I tried to wave at her
Few days later same girl I saw her on the store
Thought it was my chance but her ma was with her on the store
They were at the front I was the last person on the que
So I started coughing hope she turn and look my view
My tricks were declined so I stopped my attempts
After they were done they forgot to buy pens
She asked me to buy for her cause I was next on the till
When I was done they said thanks but still

Heard hyenas laughing in the halls, grinning along with her
The demons showed her the way to the chambers
And there innocent and pale slept the soon to be dead queen
And so the chase began
The silence covered the corridors, no one could hear her beg for help

Archive: Study Skills 13/14 A Rose for Emily,misc,Rbrinkmann,2013,89,{},"WHEN Miss Emily Grierson died, our whole town went to her funeral: the men through a sort of respectful affection for a fallen monument, the women mostly out of curiosity to see the inside of her house, which no one save an old man-servant--a combined gardener and cook--had seen in at least ten years.

It was a big, squarish frame house that had once been white, decorated with cupolas and spires and scrolled balconies in the heavily lightsome style of the seventies, set on what had once been our most select street. But garages and cotton gins had encroached and obliterated even the august names of that neighborhood; only Miss Emily's house was left, lifting its stubborn and coquettish decay above the cotton wagons and the gasoline pumps-an eyesore among eyesores. And now Miss Emily had gone to join the representatives of those august names where they lay in the cedar-bemused cemetery among the ranked and anonymous graves of Union and Confederate soldiers who fell at the battle of Jefferson.

Alive, Miss Emily had been a tradition, a duty, and a care; a sort of hereditary obligation upon the town, dating from that day in 1894 when Colonel Sartoris, the mayor--he who fathered the edict that no Negro woman should appear on the streets without an apron-remitted her taxes, the dispensation dating from the death of her father on into perpetuity. Not that Miss Emily would have accepted charity. Colonel Sartoris invented an involved tale to the effect that Miss Emily's father had loaned money to the town, which the town, as a matter of business, preferred this way of repaying. Only a man of Colonel Sartoris' generation and thought could have invented it, and only a woman could have believed it.

When the next generation, with its more modern ideas, became mayors and aldermen, this arrangement created some little dissatisfaction. On the first of the year they mailed her a tax notice. February came, and there was no reply. They wrote her a formal letter, asking her to call at the sheriff's office at her convenience. A week later the mayor wrote her himself, offering to call or to send his car for her, and received in reply a note on paper of an archaic shape, in a thin, flowing calligraphy in faded ink, to the effect that she no longer went out at all. The tax notice was also enclosed, without comment.

They called a special meeting of the Board of Aldermen. A deputation waited upon her, knocked at the door through which no visitor had passed since she ceased giving china-painting lessons eight or ten years earlier. They were admitted by the old Negro into a dim hall from which a stairway mounted into still more shadow. It smelled of dust and disuse--a close, dank smell. The Negro led them into the parlor. It was furnished in heavy, leather-covered furniture. When the Negro opened the blinds of one window, they could see that the leather was cracked; and when they sat down, a faint dust rose sluggishly about their thighs, spinning with slow motes in the single sun-ray. On a tarnished gilt easel before the fireplace stood a crayon portrait of Miss Emily's father.

They rose when she entered--a small, fat woman in black, with a thin gold chain descending to her waist and vanishing into her belt, leaning on an ebony cane with a tarnished gold head. Her skeleton was small and spare; perhaps that was why what would have been merely plumpness in another was obesity in her. She looked bloated, like a body long submerged in motionless water, and of that pallid hue. Her eyes, lost in the fatty ridges of her face, looked like two small pieces of coal pressed into a lump of dough as they moved from one face to another while the visitors stated their errand.

She did not ask them to sit. She just stood in the door and listened quietly until the spokesman came to a stumbling halt. Then they could hear the invisible watch ticking at the end of the gold chain.

Her voice was dry and cold. ""I have no taxes in Jefferson. Colonel Sartoris explained it to me. Perhaps one of you can gain access to the city records and satisfy yourselves.""

""But we have. We are the city authorities, Miss Emily. Didn't you get a notice from the sheriff, signed by him?""

""I received a paper, yes,"" Miss Emily said. ""Perhaps he considers himself the sheriff . . . I have no taxes in Jefferson.""

""But there is nothing on the books to show that, you see We must go by the--""
""See Colonel Sartoris. I have no taxes in Jefferson.""

""But, Miss Emily--""

""See Colonel Sartoris."" (Colonel Sartoris had been dead almost ten years.) ""I have no taxes in Jefferson. Tobe!"" The Negro appeared. ""Show these gentlemen out.""

II

So SHE vanquished them, horse and foot, just as she had vanquished their fathers thirty years before about the smell.

That was two years after her father's death and a short time after her sweetheart--the one we believed would marry her --had deserted her. After her father's death she went out very little; after her sweetheart went away, people hardly saw her at all. A few of the ladies had the temerity to call, but were not received, and the only sign of life about the place was the Negro man--a young man then--going in and out with a market basket.

""Just as if a man--any man--could keep a kitchen properly, ""the ladies said; so they were not surprised when the smell developed. It was another link between the gross, teeming world and the high and mighty Griersons.

A neighbor, a woman, complained to the mayor, Judge Stevens, eighty years old.

""But what will you have me do about it, madam?"" he said.

""Why, send her word to stop it,"" the woman said. ""Isn't there a law? ""

""I'm sure that won't be necessary,"" Judge Stevens said. ""It's probably just a snake or a rat that nigger of hers killed in the yard. I'll speak to him about it.""

The next day he received two more complaints, one from a man who came in diffident deprecation. ""We really must do something about it, Judge. I'd be the last one in the world to bother Miss Emily, but we've got to do something."" That night the Board of Aldermen met--three graybeards and one younger man, a member of the rising generation.

""It's simple enough,"" he said. ""Send her word to have her place cleaned up. Give her a certain time to do it in, and if she don't. ..""
""Dammit, sir,"" Judge Stevens said, ""will you accuse a lady to her face of smelling bad?""

So the next night, after midnight, four men crossed Miss Emily's lawn and slunk about the house like burglars, sniffing along the base of the brickwork and at the cellar openings while one of them performed a regular sowing motion with his hand out of a sack slung from his shoulder. They broke open the cellar door and sprinkled lime there, and in all the outbuildings. As they recrossed the lawn, a window that had been dark was lighted and Miss Emily sat in it, the light behind her, and her upright torso motionless as that of an idol. They crept quietly across the lawn and into the shadow of the locusts that lined the street. After a week or two the smell went away.

That was when people had begun to feel really sorry for her. People in our town, remembering how old lady Wyatt, her great-aunt, had gone completely crazy at last, believed that the Griersons held themselves a little too high for what they really were. None of the young men were quite good enough for Miss Emily and such. We had long thought of them as a tableau, Miss Emily a slender figure in white in the background, her father a spraddled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her and clutching a horsewhip, the two of them framed by the back-flung front door. So when she got to be thirty and was still single, we were not pleased exactly, but vindicated; even with insanity in the family she wouldn't have turned down all of her chances if they had really materialized.

When her father died, it got about that the house was all that was left to her; and in a way, people were glad. At last they could pity Miss Emily. Being left alone, and a pauper, she had become humanized. Now she too would know the old thrill and the old despair of a penny more or less.

The day after his death all the ladies prepared to call at the house and offer condolence and aid, as is our custom Miss Emily met them at the door, dressed as usual and with no trace of grief on her face. She told them that her father was not dead. She did that for three days, with the ministers calling on her, and the doctors, trying to persuade her to let them dispose of the body. Just as they were about to resort to law and force, she broke down, and they buried her father quickly.

We did not say she was crazy then. We believed she had to do that. We remembered all the young men her father had driven away, and we knew that with nothing left, she would have to cling to that which had robbed her, as people will.

III

SHE WAS SICK for a long time. When we saw her again, her hair was cut short, making her look like a girl, with a vague resemblance to those angels in colored church windows--sort of tragic and serene.

The town had just let the contracts for paving the sidewalks, and in the summer after her father's death they began the work. The construction company came with riggers and mules and machinery, and a foreman named Homer Barron, a Yankee--a big, dark, ready man, with a big voice and eyes lighter than his face. The little boys would follow in groups to hear him cuss the riggers, and the riggers singing in time to the rise and fall of picks. Pretty soon he knew everybody in town. Whenever you heard a lot of laughing anywhere about the square, Homer Barron would be in the center of the group. Presently we began to see him and Miss Emily on Sunday afternoons driving in the yellow-wheeled buggy and the matched team of bays from the livery stable.

At first we were glad that Miss Emily would have an interest, because the ladies all said, ""Of course a Grierson would not think seriously of a Northerner, a day laborer."" But there were still others, older people, who said that even grief could not cause a real lady to forget noblesse oblige- -

Without calling it noblesse oblige. They just said, ""Poor Emily. Her kinsfolk should come to her."" She had some kin in Alabama; but years ago her father had fallen out with them over the estate of old lady Wyatt, the crazy woman, and there was no communication between the two families. They had not even been represented at the funeral.

And as soon as the old people said, ""Poor Emily,"" the whispering began. ""Do you suppose it's really so?"" they said to one another. ""Of course it is. What else could . . ."" This behind their hands; rustling of craned silk and satin behind jalousies closed upon the sun of Sunday afternoon as the thin, swift clop-clop-clop of the matched team passed: ""Poor Emily.""

She carried her head high enough--even when we believed that she was fallen. It was as if she demanded more than ever the recognition of her dignity as the last Grierson; as if it had wanted that touch of earthiness to reaffirm her imperviousness. Like when she bought the rat poison, the arsenic. That was over a year after they had begun to say ""Poor Emily,"" and while the two female cousins were visiting her.
""I want some poison,"" she said to the druggist. She was over thirty then, still a slight woman, though thinner than usual, with cold, haughty black eyes in a face the flesh of which was strained across the temples and about the eyesockets as you imagine a lighthouse-keeper's face ought to look. ""I want some poison,"" she said.

""Yes, Miss Emily. What kind? For rats and such? I'd recom--""

""I want the best you have. I don't care what kind.""



The druggist named several. ""They'll kill anything up to an elephant. But what you want is--""

""Arsenic,"" Miss Emily said. ""Is that a good one?""

""Is . . . arsenic? Yes, ma'am. But what you want--""

""I want arsenic.""

The druggist looked down at her. She looked back at him, erect, her face like a strained flag. ""Why, of course,"" the druggist said. ""If that's what you want. But the law requires you to tell what you are going to use it for.""

Miss Emily just stared at him, her head tilted back in order to look him eye for eye, until he looked away and went and got the arsenic and wrapped it up. The Negro delivery boy brought her the package; the druggist didn't come back. When she opened the package at home there was written on the box, under the skull and bones: ""For rats.""

IV

So THE NEXT day we all said, ""She will kill herself""; and we said it would be the best thing. When she had first begun to be seen with Homer Barron, we had said, ""She will marry him."" Then we said, ""She will persuade him yet,"" because Homer himself had remarked--he liked men, and it was known that he drank with the younger men in the Elks' Club--that he was not a marrying man. Later we said, ""Poor Emily"" behind the jalousies as they passed on Sunday afternoon in the glittering buggy, Miss Emily with her head high and Homer Barron with his hat cocked and a cigar in his teeth, reins and whip in a yellow glove.

Then some of the ladies began to say that it was a disgrace to the town and a bad example to the young people. The men did not want to interfere, but at last the ladies forced the Baptist minister--Miss Emily's people were Episcopal-- to call upon her. He would never divulge what happened during that interview, but he refused to go back again. The next Sunday they again drove about the streets, and the following day the minister's wife wrote to Miss Emily's relations in Alabama.

So she had blood-kin under her roof again and we sat back to watch developments. At first nothing happened. Then we were sure that they were to be married. We learned that Miss Emily had been to the jeweler's and ordered a man's toilet set in silver, with the letters H. B. on each piece. Two days later we learned that she had bought a complete outfit of men's clothing, including a nightshirt, and we said, ""They are married."" We were really glad. We were glad because the two female cousins were even more Grierson than Miss Emily had ever been.

So we were not surprised when Homer Barron--the streets had been finished some time since--was gone. We were a little disappointed that there was not a public blowing-off, but we believed that he had gone on to prepare for Miss Emily's coming, or to give her a chance to get rid of the cousins. (By that time it was a cabal, and we were all Miss Emily's allies to help circumvent the cousins.) Sure enough, after another week they departed. And, as we had expected all along, within three days Homer Barron was back in town. A neighbor saw the Negro man admit him at the kitchen door at dusk one evening.

And that was the last we saw of Homer Barron. And of Miss Emily for some time. The Negro man went in and out with the market basket, but the front door remained closed. Now and then we would see her at a window for a moment, as the men did that night when they sprinkled the lime, but for almost six months she did not appear on the streets. Then we knew that this was to be expected too; as if that quality of her father which had thwarted her woman's life so many times had been too virulent and too furious to die.

When we next saw Miss Emily, she had grown fat and her hair was turning gray. During the next few years it grew grayer and grayer until it attained an even pepper-and-salt iron-gray, when it ceased turning. Up to the day of her death at seventy-four it was still that vigorous iron-gray, like the hair of an active man.

From that time on her front door remained closed, save for a period of six or seven years, when she was about forty, during which she gave lessons in china-painting. She fitted up a studio in one of the downstairs rooms, where the daughters and granddaughters of Colonel Sartoris' contemporaries were sent to her with the same regularity and in the same spirit that they were sent to church on Sundays with a twenty-five-cent piece for the collection plate. Meanwhile her taxes had been remitted.

Then the newer generation became the backbone and the spirit of the town, and the painting pupils grew up and fell away and did not send their children to her with boxes of color and tedious brushes and pictures cut from the ladies' magazines. The front door closed upon the last one and remained closed for good. When the town got free postal delivery, Miss Emily alone refused to let them fasten the metal numbers above her door and attach a mailbox to it. She would not listen to them.

Daily, monthly, yearly we watched the Negro grow grayer and more stooped, going in and out with the market basket. Each December we sent her a tax notice, which would be returned by the post office a week later, unclaimed. Now and then we would see her in one of the downstairs windows--she had evidently shut up the top floor of the house--like the carven torso of an idol in a niche, looking or not looking at us, we could never tell which. Thus she passed from generation to generation--dear, inescapable, impervious, tranquil, and perverse.

And so she died. Fell ill in the house filled with dust and shadows, with only a doddering Negro man to wait on her. We did not even know she was sick; we had long since given up trying to get any information from the Negro

He talked to no one, probably not even to her, for his voice had grown harsh and rusty, as if from disuse.

She died in one of the downstairs rooms, in a heavy walnut bed with a curtain, her gray head propped on a pillow yellow and moldy with age and lack of sunlight.

V

THE NEGRO met the first of the ladies at the front door and let them in, with their hushed, sibilant voices and their quick, curious glances, and then he disappeared. He walked right through the house and out the back and was not seen again.

The two female cousins came at once. They held the funeral on the second day, with the town coming to look at Miss Emily beneath a mass of bought flowers, with the crayon face of her father musing profoundly above the bier and the ladies sibilant and macabre; and the very old men --some in their brushed Confederate uniforms--on the porch and the lawn, talking of Miss Emily as if she had been a contemporary of theirs, believing that they had danced with her and courted her perhaps, confusing time with its mathematical progression, as the old do, to whom all the past is not a diminishing road but, instead, a huge meadow which no winter ever quite touches, divided from them now by the narrow bottle-neck of the most recent decade of years.

Already we knew that there was one room in that region above stairs which no one had seen in forty years, and which would have to be forced. They waited until Miss Emily was decently in the ground before they opened it.

The violence of breaking down the door seemed to fill this room with pervading dust. A thin, acrid pall as of the tomb seemed to lie everywhere upon this room decked and furnished as for a bridal: upon the valance curtains of faded rose color, upon the rose-shaded lights, upon the dressing table, upon the delicate array of crystal and the man's toilet things backed with tarnished silver, silver so tarnished that the monogram was obscured. Among them lay a collar and tie, as if they had just been removed, which, lifted, left upon the surface a pale crescent in the dust. Upon a chair hung the suit, carefully folded; beneath it the two mute shoes and the discarded socks.

The man himself lay in the bed.

For a long while we just stood there, looking down at the profound and fleshless grin. The body had apparently once lain in the attitude of an embrace, but now the long sleep that outlasts love, that conquers even the grimace of love, had cuckolded him. What was left of him, rotted beneath what was left of the nightshirt, had become inextricable from the bed in which he lay; and upon him and upon the pillow beside him lay that even coating of the patient and biding dust.

Then we noticed that in the second pillow was the indentation of a head. One of us lifted something from it, and leaning forward, that faint and invisible dust dry and acrid in the nostrils, we saw a long strand of iron-gray hair.",305554,en,en,en,

""I choose to reflect the times and situations in which I find myself. That, to me, is my duty. And at this crucial time in our lives, when everything is so desperate, when everyday is a matter of survival, I don't think you can help but be involved. Young people, black and white, know this. That's why they're so involved in politics. We will shape and mold this country or it will not be molded and shaped at all anymore. So I don't think you have a choice. How can you be an artist and not reflect the times?""",2865069,en,en,en,1YzmZx56gqJY77BSNrID31
Lonesome,rap,Kvilan,2020,7,{},"[Chorus]
I been on the longest road
Where I'm going, I don't know
Do remember where I've been
But never let it be my end
All the energy I send
Hope for something in the end
If it don't come back to me
I'll lay to rest without a peep
I been on the longest road
Where I'm going, I don't know
Do remember where I've been
But never let it be my end
All the energy I send
Hope for something in the end
If it don't come back to me
I'll lay to rest without a peep

[Verse]
Is my loneliness an illness?
Or a strength?
Life is so subjective
Waste time debating length
Those measurements are never clear
Because they're ever changing
Always need replacing
So you always need vacation
Can't travel externally
It's time to bring it inward
I squeeze the Grapes of Wrath
Until I build myself a vineyard
I walk along the path
That I created facing windward
My vision grants me clarity
Precisely as I pictured
Like a scripture
The shit that I deliver
I'm aiming for the head
Each time I pull one out the quiver
I now recover quicker
Resilience becomes a tool
The man who tries to wear a mask for some
Ends up a fucking fool
Sometimes I wonder why its hard as it is
Or if I should've focused
Started off as a kid
Sometimes I wonder when I started to live
Or maybe this the end
Survival's a bitch

[Chorus]
I been on the longest road
Where I'm going, I don't know
Do remember where I've been
But never let it be my end
All the energy I send
Hope for something in the end
If it don't come back to me
I'll lay to rest without a peep
I been on the longest road
Where I'm going, I don't know
Do remember where I've been
But never let it be my end
All the energy I send
Hope for something in the end
If it don't come back to me
I'll lay to rest without a peep

[Verse]
Lay me down
Bury me with my crown
And if it seems I'm not a king
Throw me over to drown
Throw me over
Overthrowing the culture
That caters to the vultures
And any one of the skulkers
In the shadows
We out here doing battle on the front lines
Y'all hiding in the back
Whenever it turn to crunch time
It's tough times
Approaching and arriving
They robbing from us still
But people asking if I'm signing
A deal, no thank you
What I should do is spank you
Offer a mil, I'm worth a bil
So fuck you
I'm doing this shit by myself
We all lost, so fuck it, I'ma try myself
Rather die myself
Than not know my worth, let y'all burn in hell
And then the snow reveal
All the hurt we feel
Let it go and heal
And as it turn to hail, yell

[Chorus]
I been on the longest road
Where I'm going, I don't know
Do remember where I've been

When will they come back home, will they be the same?

These are the things that I think about

I never called on you before
There's one thing I got to know

Sometimes took this life for granted
Never called you by your name
Always tried to live right by you
Could I be the one to blame?

Of all the things you could take from me
That's just too much pain to bear
Trading on my life's ambitions
Grant me please this one last prayer

Begging, please, God give him shelter
When the rain begins to fall
Shine your light on him for guidance
When his back's against the wall
I will feel the fire burnin'
See him in the darkest night
Almost taste the air he's breathin'
Near the whispers of his thoughts

Never had to fault religion (Faulter)
Always made my own decisions (On my own)
Never cared for reasons why (Reasons why)
Ends, my means, I justified (Justify)

That was one of the things I lost
That was one of the things I lost hard

That me and Susie had looked away for a terrible moment, and this reflected savagely on everything else
A belief in the good in things, in the world, in ourselves evaporated
But you know, after a while, after a time, Susie and I decided to be happy

An act of defiance

A Louse Is Not a Home,rock,Peter Hammill,1974,2647,{},"[Verse 1]
Sometimes it's very scary here, sometimes it's very sad
Sometimes I think I'll disappear; betimes I think I have
There's a line snaking down my mirror
Splintered glass distorts my face
And though the light is strong and strange
It can't illuminate the musty corners of this place
There is a lofty, lonely, Lohengrenic castle in the clouds;
Yes, and I draw my murky meanings there
But seven years' dark luck is just around the corner
And in the shadows lurks the spectre of Despair

[Bridge 1]
A cracked mirror 'mid the drapes of the landing:
Split image, labored understanding...
I'm only trying to find a place to hide my home

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus 1]
I've lived in houses composed of glass
Where every movement is charted
But now the monitor screens are dark
And I can't tell if silent eyes are there
My words are spiders upon the page
They spin out faith, hope and reason -
But are they meet and just, or only dust
Gathering about my chair?
[Post-Chorus 2]
Sometimes I get the feeling
That there's someone else there:
The faceless watcher makes me uneasy;
I can feel him through the floorboards
And His presence is creepy
He informs me that I shall be expelled
What is that but out of and into?
Don't know the nature of the door that I'd go through
Don't know the nature of the nature that I am inside...

[Chorus 2]
I've lived in houses of brick and lead
Where all emotion is sacred
And if you want to devour the fruit
You must first sniff at the fragrance
And lay your body before the shrine
With poems and posies and papers
Or, if you spot the ruse, you'll have to choose
To stay, a monk, or leave, a vagrant

[Post-Chorus 2]
What is this place you call home?
Is it a sermon or a confession?
Is it the chalice that you use for protection?
Is it really only somewhere you can stay?
Is it a rule-book or a lecture?
Is it a beating at the hands of your Protector?
Does the idol have feet of clay?
[Verse 2]
Home is what you make it
So my friends all say
But I rarely see their homes in these dark days
Some of them are snails
And carry houses on their backs;
Others live in monuments
Which, one day, will be racks
I keep my home in place
With sellotape and tin-tacks;
But I still feel there's some other Force here...
He who cracks the mirrors and moves the walls
Keeps staring through
The eye-slits of the portraits in my hall
He ravages my library and taps the telephone
I've never actually seen Him
But I know He's in my home
And if he goes away
I can't stay here either
I believe... Er... I think...
Well, I don't know...

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 4]
I only live in one room at a time
But all of the walls are ears and all the windows, eyes
Everything else is foreign
And 'home' is my wordless chant:
Mmmmmaah!
Give it a chance!
[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
I am surrounded by flesh and bone
I am a temple of living
I am a hermit, I am a drone
And I am boring out a place to be
With secret garlands about my head
Unearthly silence is broken
The room is growing dark, and in the stark light
I see a face I know

[Post-Chorus 3]
Could this be the guy who never shows
The cracked mirror what he's feeling
Merely mumbles prayers to the ground where he's kneeling:
""Home is home is home is home is home is home is home is me!""?
All you people looking for your houses
Don't throw your weight around
You might break your glasses
And if you do, you know you just can't see

[Verse 5]
And then how are you to find
The dawning of the day?
Day is just a word I use
To keep the dark at bay
People are imaginary, nothing else exists
Except the room I'm sitting in
And, of course, the all-pervading mist -
Sometimes I wonder if even that's real

[Verse 6]
Maybe I should de-louse this place
Maybe I should de-place this louse
Maybe I'll maybe my life away
In the confines of this silent house

[Outro]
Sometimes it's very scary here, sometimes it's very sad
Sometimes I think I'll disappear, sometimes I think...

Okay I'm so beyond it
From Mill Basin to Coney Island
I'm south Brooklyn's finest
I did a lot
But I still gotta top it
I guess you cursed with that
When you got a habit to polish
So I be in the lab workin like Dexter and Deedee
'Cause you only as good as the last records you dropping
And I can't break my promise
You dudes be out of pocket
So you don't get the time of day
Or no cash from my wallet
Work on your craft for you comment
I was in the basement with Trevor and chronic
Rappin under blankets and smokin some chronic
Lower the music because his mom sleepin
But the loud got us here
How fuckin ironic
They called me dumb and obnoxious
But now I'm young and iconic
Joel Embiid
Gotta trust in the process
Went from underage drinking hypnotic
Dreaming bout makin profit
Lost some soldiers who was vital to the progress
I know they pullin some strings from above me
So I can't let them down yo I promise
I'm done being modest
I'm getting everything and more
Til I'm rotted
Just a product of the people who believed in the kid
I owe it all to ya
I'll be the vessel for ya
I know this game is both a gift and a curse
But things could be worse

Things could be worse

Float off my tongue

Im from where they buckshots
And all the Jamaicans scream Bloodclawt
I was one block
Away when they shot up the bus stop
Ain't see one cop
The hood was so hot
And in such shocked
Keep a gun cocked
Or you gonna end up the one popped
Seventeen, I was stepping over empty shell cases
Crime scenes, yellow tape, I've seen plenty pale faces
We stay heated, but we always wondered where this Hell place is
Might come off as lil harsh might as well face it
This still ain't easy to grasp
Connecting with friends or fam
Is a thing of the past
Call and check up someone, it's a struggle just to do that
Just because they just seen you post what I doing on to an app
I think that that shit is wack
My work will speak for itself, I'm done talking
I'll get so off radar they gon' be the ones stalking
All I ever heard dog barking and gun sparking
But in 2021 I'll be seeing my son walking
The person I'm becoming
Better than the one I was
Lost some friends over the years
Gave up tryna be a thug
Some ain't dead they still alive
Some of them deserve a slug
We all got naysayers
You could tell 'em join the club
I did it all for ya
And you did nothing for me
I know this game is both a gift and a curse

Arctic wind will be washed from my hair

As you grow you'll understand
Why I left

Remember when I'd cry into my soup

[Verse 1, Chip]
Perched upon a precipice, a pestilent theater
Before a ruckus audience, a masturbating gator
And hungry troglodytes and a burning spot light
I suffocate beneath caked on makeup and hot tight tattered attire
Mothy, Musty and Dusty
Sharing the days with tumbleweeds and bumblebees
And prepubescent pygmies and knee pumps
Shaking rumps on platforms of tree stumps

And in the back of the room
Illuminated by the glow of a torch
Which will soon aid my fated fault
Of mob hysteria, the face of my father
And the pitchfork he forged for the following slaughter

And dance with abandon, and toot on my trumpet
And I defy death as I defy thrown bottles
And over-ripe fruit and everything awful

Seemingly unnoticed by the powers of life
To identify the meaning of my dreams
The rocks in the shades are witnesses
Of my remaining depressingly
As I kept on going just to stop at a well

Entering the well I felt like Christ
At his descent down to hell

Observed by creatures while intruding their realm
With my soul burning and my mind confused
I went on in this maze of darkness
Driven onward by powers unseen

The impending nearness of the Prince of Death
I passed the broken well of my dreams
Reimparting strength into my inmost self
And Accepting dreams as a means of resistance

Entering the well I felt like Christ

Watch another tank of gasoline run dry
A death stare from a cold, dead eye
As you're chopping up the carrot
Sharpening their knives
Don't blink, keep your eyes on the prize
While you rip me into pieces
Cut me down to size
Don't dare, try to keep it inside

Is to make us cry

A storm awaits behind the door
Disgruntled right down to the core

Leaves me terrified

Who gives a shit 'bout mine?
Death grips got a hold of my side

The Conquest of Bread Chapter 6: Dwellings,misc,Peter Kropotkin,1892,2,{},"I
THOSE who have closely watched the growth of certain ideas among the workers must have noticed that on one momentous question—the housing of the people, namely—a definite conclusion is being imperceptibly arrived at. It is a known fact that in the large towns of France, and in many of the smaller ones also, the workers are coming gradually to the conclusion that dwelling-houses are in no sense the property of those whom thе State recognizes as thеir owners.

This idea has evolved naturally in the minds of the people, and nothing will ever convince them again that the ""rights of property"" ought to extend to houses.

The house was not built by its owner. It was erected, decorated, and furnished by innumerable workers—in the timber yard, the brick field, and the workshop, toiling for dear life at a minimum wage.

he money spent by the owner was not the product of his own toil. It was amassed, like all other riches, by paying the workers two-thirds or only a half of what was their due.

Moreover—and it is here that the enormity of the whole proceeding becomes most glaring—the house owes its actual value to the profit which the owner can make out of it. Now, this profit results from the fact that his house is built in a town possessing bridges, quays, and fine public buildings, and affording to its inhabitants a thousand comforts and conveniences unknown in villages; a town well paved, lighted with gas, in regular communication with other towns, and itself a centre of industry, commerce, science, and art; a town which the work of twenty or thirty generations has gone to render habitable, healthy, and beautiful.

A house in certain parts of Paris may be valued at thousands of pounds sterling, not because thousands of pounds' worth of labour have been expended on that particular house, but because it is in Paris; because for centuries workmen, artists, thinkers, and men of learning and letters have contributed to make Paris what it is to-day—a centre of industry, commerce, politics, art, and science; because Paris has a past ; because, thanks to literature, the names of its streets are household words in foreign countries as well as at home; because it is the fruit of eighteen centuries of toil, the work of fifty generations of the whole French nation.

Who, then, can appropriate to himself the tiniest plot of ground, or the meanest building, without committing a flagrant injustice? Who, then, has the right to sell to any bidder the smallest portion of the common heritage?

On that point, as we have said, the workers are agreed. The idea of free dwellings showed its existence very plainly during the siege of Paris, when the cry was for an abatement pure and simple of the terms demanded by the landlords. It appeared again during the Commune of 1871, when the Paris workmen expected the Communal Council to decide boldly on the abolition of rent. And when the New Revolution comes, it will be the first question with which the poor will concern themselves.

Whether in time of revolution or in time of peace, the worker must be housed somehow or other; he must have some sort of roof over his head. But, however tumble-down and squallid your dwelling may be, there is always a landlord who can evict you. True, during the Revolution he cannot find bailiffs and police-serjeants to throw your rags and chattels into the street, but who knows what the new Government will do to-morrow? Who can say that it will not call in the aid of force again, and set the police pack upon you to hound you out of your hovels?

We have seen the Commune proclaim the remission of rents due up to the first of April only![1]
After that rent had to be paid, though Paris was in a state of chaos, and industry at a standstill; so that the revolutionist had absolutely nothing to depend upon but his allowance of fifteen pence a day!

Now the worker must be made to see clearly that in refusing to pay rent to a landlord or owner he is not simply profiting by the disorganization of authority. He must understand that the abolition of rent is a recognized principle, sanctioned, so to speak, by popular assent; that to be housed rent-free is a right proclaimed aloud by the people.

Are we going to wait till this measure, which is in harmony with every honest man's sense of justice, is taken up by the few socialists scattered among the middle-class elements, of which the Provisionary Government will be composed? We should have to wait long—till the return of reaction, in fact!

This is why, refusing uniforms and badges—those outward signs of authority and servitude—and remaining people among the people, the earnest revolutionists will work side by side with the masses, that the abolition of rent, the expropriation of houses, may become an accomplished fact. They will prepare the ground and encourage ideas to grow in this direction; and when the fruit of their labours is ripe, the people will proceed to expropriate the houses without giving heed to the theories which will certainly be thrust in their way—theories about paying compensation to landlords, and finding first the necessary funds.

On the day that the expropriation of houses takes place, on that day, the exploited workers will have realized that the new times have come, that Labour will no longer have to bear the yoke of the rich and powerful, that Equality has been openly proclaimed, that this Revolution is a real fact, and not a theatrical make-believe, like so many others preceding it.

II
If the idea of expropriation be adopted by the people it will be carried into effect in spite of all the ""insurmountable"" obstacles with which we are menaced.

Of course, the good folk in new uniforms, seated in the official arm-chairs of the Hôtel de Ville, will be sure to busy themselves in heaping up obstacles. They will talk of giving compensation to the landlords, of preparing statistics, and drawing up long reports. Yes, they would be capable of drawing up reports long enough to outlast the hopes of the people, who, after waiting and starving in enforced idleness, and seeing nothing come of all these official researches, would lose heart and faith in the Revolution and abandon the field to the reactionaries. The new bureaucracy would end by making expropriation hateful in the eyes of all.

Here, indeed, is a rock which might shipwreck our hopes. But if the people turn a deaf ear to the specious arguments used to dazzle them, and realize that new life needs new conditions, and if they undertake the task themselves, then expropriation can be effected without any great difficulty.

""But how? How can it be done?"" you ask us. We shall try to reply to this question, but with a reservation. We have no intention of tracing out the plans of expropriation in their smallest details. We know beforehand that all that any man, or group of men, could suggest to-day would be far surpassed by the reality when it comes. Man will accomplish greater things, and accomplish them better and by simpler methods than those dictated to him beforehand. Thus we are content to indicate the manner by which expropriation might be accomplished without the intervention of Government. We do not propose to go out of our way to answer those who declare that the thing is impossible. We confine ourselves to replying that we are not the upholders of any particular method of organization. We are only concerned to demonstrate that expropriation could be effected by popular initiative, and could not be effected by any other means whatever.

It seems very likely that, as soon as expropriation is fairly started, groups of volunteers will spring up in every district, street, and block of houses, and undertake to inquire into the number of flats and houses which are empty and of those which are overcrowded, the unwholesome slums and the houses which are too spacious for their occupants and might well be used to house those who are stifled in swarming tenements. In a few days these volunteers would have drawn up complete lists for the street and the district of all the flats, tenements, family mansions and villa residences, all the rooms and suites of rooms, healthy and unhealthy, small and large, fœtid dens and homes of luxury.

Freely communicating with each other, these volunteers would soon have their statistics complete. False statistics can be manufactured in board rooms and offices, but true and exact statistics must begin with the individual and mount up from the simple to the complex.

Then, without waiting for any one's leave, those citizens will probably go and find their comrades who were living in miserable garrets and hovels and will say to them simply: ""It is a real Revolution this time, comrades, and no mistake about it. Come to such a place this evening; all the neighbourhood will be there; we are going to redistribute the dwelling-houses. If you are tired of your slum-garret, come and choose one of the flats of five rooms that are to be disposed of, and when you have once moved in you shall stay, never fear. The people are up in arms, and he who would venture to evict you will have to answer to them.""

""But every one will want a fine house or a spacious flat!"" we are told. No, you are mistaken. It is not the people's way to clamour for the moon. On the contrary, every time we have seen them set about repairing a wrong we have been struck by the good sense and instinct for justice which animates the masses. Have we ever known them demand the impossible? Have we ever seen the people of Paris fighting among themselves while waiting for their rations of bread or firewood during the two sieges? The patience and resignation which prevailed among them was constantly held up to admiration by the foreign Press correspondents; and yet these patient waiters knew full well that the last comers would have to pass the day without food or fire.
We do not deny that there are plenty of egotistic instincts in isolated individuals in our societies. We are quite aware of it. But we contend that the very way to revive and nourish these instincts would be to confine such questions as the housing of the people to any board or committee, in fact, to the tender mercies of officialism in any shape or form. Then indeed all the evil passions spring up, and it becomes a case of who is the most influential person on the board. The least inequality causes wranglings and recriminations. If the smallest advantage is given to any one, a tremendous hue and cry is raised—and not without reason.

But if the people themselves, organized by streets, districts, and parishes, undertake to move the inhabitants of the slums into the half-empty dwellings of the middle classes, the trifling inconveniences, the little inequalities will be easily tided over. Rarely has appeal been made to the good instincts of the masses—only as a last resort, to save the sinking ship in times of revolution—but never has such an appeal been made in vain; the heroism, the self-devotion of the toiler has never failed to respond to it. And thus it will be in the coming Revolution.

But, when all is said and done, some inequalities, some inevitable injustices, will remain. There are individuals in our societies whom no great crisis can lift out of the deep ruts of egoism in which they are sunk. The question, however, is not whether there will be injustices or no, but rather how to limit the number of them.

Now all history, all the experience of the human race, and all social psychology, unite in showing that the best and fairest way is to trust the decision to those whom it concerns most nearly. It is they alone who can consider and allow for the hundred and one details which must necessarily be overlooked in any merely official redistribution.

III
Moreover, it is by no means necessary to make straightway an absolutely equal redistribution of all the dwellings. There will no doubt be some inconveniences at first, but matters will soon be righted in a society which has adopted expropriation.

When the masons, and carpenters, and all who are concerned in house building, know that their daily bread is secured to them, they will ask nothing better than to work at their old trades a few hours a day. They will adapt the fine houses which absorbed the time of a whole staff of servants, and in a few months homes will have sprung up, infinitely healthier and more conveniently arranged than those of to-day. And to those who are not yet comfortably housed the anarchist Commune will be able to say: ""Patience, comrades! Palaces fairer and finer than any the capitalists built for themselves will spring from the ground of our enfranchised city. They will belong to those who have most need of them. The anarchist Commune does not build with an eye to revenues. These monuments erected to its citizens, products of the collective spirit, will serve as models to all humanity; they will be yours.""

If the people of the Revolution expropriate the houses and proclaim free lodgings—the communalizing of houses and the right of each family to a decent dwelling—then the Revolution will have assumed a communistic character from the first, and started on a course from which it will be by no means easy to turn it. It will have struck a fatal blow at individual property.

For the expropriation of dwellings contains in germ the whole social revolution. On the manner of its accomplishment depends the character of all that follows. Either we shall start on a good road leading straight to anarchist communism, or we shall remain sticking in the mud of despotic individualism.

It is easy to see the numerous objections—theoretic on the one hand, practical on the other—with which we are sure to be met. As it will be a question of maintaining iniquity at any price, our opponents will of course protest ""in the name of justice."" ""Is it not a crying shame,"" they will exclaim, ""that the people of Paris should take possession of all these fine houses, while the peasants in the country have only tumble-down huts to live in?"" But do not let us make a mistake. These enthusiasts for justice forget, by a lapse of memory to which they are subject, the ""crying shame"" which they themselves are tacitly defending. They forget that in this same city the worker, with his wife and children, suffocates in a noisome garret, while from his window he sees the rich man's palace. They forget that whole generations perish in crowded slums, starving for air and sunlight, and that to redress this injustice ought to be the first task of the Revolution.

Do not let these disingenuous protests hold us back. We know that any inequality which may exist between town and country in the early days of the Revolution will be transitory and of a nature to right itself from day to day; for the village will not fail to improve its dwellings as soon as the peasant has ceased to be the beast of burden of the farmer, the merchant, the moneylender, and the State. In order to avoid an accidental and transitory inequality, shall we stay our hand from righting an ancient wrong?

The so-called practical objections are not very formidable either. We are bidden to consider the hard case of some poor fellow who by dint of privation has contrived to buy a house just large enough to hold his family. And we are going to deprive him of his hard-earned happiness, to turn him into the street! Certainly not. If his house is only just large enough for his family, by all means let him stay there. Let him work in his little garden too; our ""boys"" will not hinder him—nay, they will lend him a helping hand if need be. But suppose he lets lodgings, suppose he has empty rooms in his house; then the people will make the lodger understand that he need not pay his former landlord any more rent. Stay where you are, but rent free. No more duns and collectors; Socialism has abolished all that!

Or again, suppose that the landlord has a score of rooms all to himself, and some poor woman lives near by with five children in one room. In that case the people would see whether, with some alterations, these empty rooms could not be converted into a suitable home for the poor woman and her five children. Would not that be more just and fair than to leave the mother and her five little ones languishing in a garret, while Sir Gorgeous Midas sat at his ease in an empty mansion? Besides, good Sir Gorgeous would probably hasten to do it of his own accord; his wife will be delighted to be freed from half her big, unwieldy house when there is no longer a staff of servants to keep it in order.

""So you are going to turn everything upside down,"" say the defenders of law and order. ""There will be no end to the evictions and removals. Would it not be better to start fresh by turning everybody out of doors and redistributing the houses by lot?"" Thus our critics; but we are firmly persuaded that if no Government interferes in the matter, if all the changes are entrusted to those free groups which have sprung up to undertake the work, the evictions and removals will be less numerous than those which take place in one year under the present system, owing to the rapacity of landlords.
In the first place, there are in all large towns almost enough empty houses and flats to lodge all the inhabitants of the slums. As to the palaces and suites of fine apartments, many working people would not live in them if they could. One could not ""keep up"" such houses without a large staff of servants. Their occupants would soon find themselves forced to seek less luxurious dwellings. The fine ladies would find that palaces were not well adapted to self-help in the kitchen. Gradually people would shake down. There would be no need to conduct Dives to a garret at the bayonet's point, or install Lazarus in Dives's palace by the help of an armed escort. People would shake down amicably into the available dwellings with the least possible friction and disturbance. Have we not the example of the village communes redistributing fields and disturbing the owners of the allotments so little that one can only praise the intelligence and good sense of the methods they employ. Fewer fields change hands under the management of the Russian Commune than where personal property holds sway, and is for ever carrying its quarrels into courts of law. And are we to believe that the inhabitants of a great European city would be less intelligent and less capable of organization than Russian or Hindoo peasants?

Moreover, we must not blink the fact that every revolution means a certain disturbance to everyday life, and those who expect this tremendous lift out of the old grooves to be accomplished without so much as jarring the dishes on their dinner tables will find themselves mistaken. It is true that Governments can change without disturbing worthy citizens at dinner, but the crimes of society towards those who have nourished and supported it are not to be redressed by any such political sleight of parties.

Undoubtedly there will be a disturbance, but it must not be of pure destruction; it must be minimized. And again—it is impossible to lay too much stress on this maxim—it will be by addressing ourselves to the interested parties, and not to boards and committees, that we shall best succeed in reducing the sum of inconveniences for everybody.

The people commit blunder on blunder when they have to choose by ballot some hare-brained candidate who solicits the honour of representing them, and takes upon himself to know all, to do all, and to organize all. But when they take upon themselves to organize what they know, what touches them directly, they do it better than all the ""talking-shops"" put together. Is not the Paris Commune an instance in point? and the great dockers' strike? and have we not constant evidence of this fact in every village commune?[1]The decree of the 30 March: by this decree rents due up to the terms of October, 1870, and January and April, 1871, were annulled.",7303431,en,en,en,

Does it feel like you have lost you heart?

I see you in all that's good

It will shine through every time

To tell you that you've failed to come across
All your friends are distant stars
I know they'll come to show
To save the spark that we all know

Why can't I see the sweet things until they're all gone

Sitting on the grass at your mother's grave
Staring at the letters that spell my name
Stars still shine in a sky blue sky
You just gotta look with better eyes
I lay face down in the summer dirt
My ear pressed into the conducting earth
I hear radio waves and ghosts that fizzle and fade

I said I got ID'd today
You said ""ya, I get that too

Lost amongst those
Who long ago lost faith in humanity
This pill for an ill world
Will blindly swallow anything
And crush our true leaders and the hope they bring
Were pushed to the ground
The slaving classes who will control the unruly masses
When they finally refuse to obey their masses
Nobody can stop the upper tier
And their relentless forces that instil fear
Every new face is just another puppeteer

See them swell before my eyes

The high dark ice veiled mountain
With the silent mystic castle walls
Are now showing their lament

The sad magic dance of my white elves...
Sing to mark the past of hero
Sing to cry his tragic destiny
And to lead him on his way

While the fire burns and their hands now rise
To the crystal sky for the warrior's pride
May the mighty king ride the wind of dreams
Breath in our trees freeing us from sin

On the golden throne of Irekan
She is fighting back her tears
Her sad future so without her king
Will be too hard to endure

Now the valiant knights of twilight come
All from the farest midlands
'cause the songs of jester reached their crown
And so now they come for him
While the fire burns and their hands now rise
To the crystal sky for the warrior's pride
May the mighty king ride the wind of dreams
Breath in our trees freeing us from sin

Careless love, you left me a broken home
You're all I have, don't let me go
Careless love, I'll never truly know
You're all I have, don't let me go

You'll never see me the same way you thought you did when we were still in love
And I don't think you want to see who I've become

I know I had so much more to give, but I gave up
Now I lay stuck in the sheets of the grave I dug
Don't try and save me

Careless love, you left me a broken home
You're all I have, don't let me go
Careless love, I'll never truly know
You're all I have, don't let me go
I don't think I'll even sleep tonight, but I'll wake up and I'll think of someone else
We'll be on our own, and I'll be on the road with the world staring back at me
I never thought this is what it would be like, it all just changed
It's got me caving in (I feel like caving in)
Now we're on our own and feeling so alone
We'll be on the road again with the world at our hands

And let the world bump your shit from the blocks to their homes
From your whips to your phones, from the streets to your beats

Running through these tracks like black girls in salons

Wetting me gruesome.  Quest to get this twosome

Tricking in dormitories, sticking, Kodak shots of all my pickings
This one particular bad baby had this brother on her
Mission for this brown-skinned sugar, tasty dishing
Loving them curves, hugging that sweater, body was kicking
(Flavorful) Met her at the laundromat washing her Vicky Secrets
I came through, plus she seen my steez and peeped it.  We clicked
Effeminate charm mature, my masculinity raw like
Lions hunting for lionesses, my campus missus—huh
But at yourself you threw disses, which is the reason
Missus get dismisses, step with no kisses.  “Yo, Chrome, your thing

Timeline 1 Slavery  African American Family Structure,misc,Keith Shynett,2015,14,{},"Timeline #1


Today many African Americans live in a non-traditional family structure compared to the normal 2 parent male dominant household that society expects. Some live with single mothers because of their fathers are in prison, or simply because they are not in the picture. Surely, this isn’t just a natural occurrence for African Americans, in fact I’ll argue that this was a product of America’s slavery system. In this timeline I’ll reflect on dates significant in African American literary history along with text to support my claim that slavery damaged African American family structure.  Slavery separated families and stripped black men of a typical fathering role that continues to persist in the modern era.



1837- The Philadelphia Vigilance Committee is organized to help fugitive slaves escape their pursuers
Excerpt from Victor Sejour’s “The Mulatto” (1837)
‘Well! I can remember…the master said to the slave: you saved my life; what can I grant you in return? Do you want your freedom? ‘Master,’ answered the slave, ‘I can never be free, while my son and my wife are slaves’

1844- On June 25, the Legislative Committee of the Provisional Government of Oregon enacts the first of a series of Black Exclusion Laws
Excerpt from Frederick Douglass’ “Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass”
“My mother and I were separated when I was but an infant-before I knew her as my mother. It is a common custom, in the part of Maryland from which I ran away, to part children from their mothers at a very early age. Frequently, before the child has reached its twelfth month, its mother is taken from it, and hired out on some farm a considerable distance off, and the child is placed under the care of an old woman, too old for field labor. For what this separation is done, I do not know, unless it to hinder the development of the child’s affection towards its mother.”

1847-Missouri abolitionist file a lawsuit on behalf of Dred Scott
Excerpt from “Clotel:or, The President’s Daughter”
“As husband and wife through each other become conscious of complete humanity, and every human feeling, and every human virtue; so children, at their first awakening in the fond covenant of love between parents, both of whom are tenderly concerned for the same object, find an image of complete humanity leagued in free love… If this be a true picture of the vast influence for good of the institution of marriage, what must be the moral degradation of that people to whom marriage is denied?”

1854- Fugitive slave Anthony Burns is captured in Boston and returned to slavery
Excerpt from “12 Years a Slave”
“Eliza was still ringing her hands and deploring the loss of her children… Eliza older child, Randall was sold away from her by Theophilus Freeman. When William Ford bought Eliza, she implored him to purchase her daughter Emily as well. Ford tried to but Freeman refused the offer.”
1865- The 13th Amendment
Excerpt from Francis Harper’s “Bury Me in a Free Land”
“I could not rest, if I saw the lash
Drinking her blood at each fearful gash;
And I saw her babes torn from her breast,
Like trembling doves from their parents flesh”

1890- The Afro-American League is founded
Excerpt from Charles Chesnutt’s “The Wife of His Youth”
“He may have married another woman. Your slave marriage would not have prevented him, for you never lived with him after the war, and without that your marriage doesn't count.”

1900- The National Negro Business League is founded by Booker T. Washington
Excerpt from Booker T. Washington’s “From Up From Slavery”
“I have been unsuccessful in securing any information that would throw any accurate light upon the history of my family beyond my mother… My mother, I suppose, attracted the attention of a purchaser who was afterward my owner and hers. Her addition to the slave family attracted about as much attention as the purchase of a new horse or cow. Of my father I know even less than of my mother. .. Whoever he was, I never heard of his taking any interest in me or providing in any way for my rearing.”

1903- W.E.B. Du Bois’ “The Souls of Black Folks” is published
This excerpt is from W.E.B. Du Bois’ “The Souls of Black Folks”
“The history of the American Negro is the history of this strife, this longing to obtain self-conscious manhood, to merge his double self into a better and truer self. In this merging he wishes neither of the older selves to be lost. He would not Africanize America, for America has too much to teach the world and Africa. He would not bleach his Negro soul in a flood of white Americanism, for he knows that Negro blood has a message for the world. He simply wishes to make it possible for a man to be both a Negro and an American, without being cursed and split upon by his fellow, without having the doors of Opportunity closed roughly in his face.”",2316159,en,en,en,

As darkness feeling our pride

Screaming echos in the air
Feel the burning flame inside
A kiss of death I will receive
For invoking melodies
Evil spheres enclose my soul
Awaiting (a) mournful symphony

Shadows are grasping - devouring misery
Shining of demons - destroying my faith

From the darkest abyss
Where the laughter pierce the air
They arrive with thunderstorms form the sky
Bloodred melodies
When the silence crushed by dead
As they riding through my soul and my fear
Lying in the shadows
In the place where roses die
Dreaming beauty waiting for her bloodred kiss of death
As the angels singing echos in the torpid sphere of dark

Awaiting in the shadows
Wolves running by my side
Damnation reach the beauty
Wept upon the waveless lake
A velvet painting appearing
On the bloodred moonlight sky

Shadows are grasping - devouring misery
Shining of demons - destroying my faith

Through the spheres of pain

Fulfilled in Christ, the Man
For He lives: Christ is risen from the dead!

[Verse 2]
See Mary weeping, “Where is He laid?”
As in sorrow she turns from the empty tomb
Hears a voice speaking, calling her name
It’s the Master, the Lord raised to life again!
The voice that spans the years
Speaking life, stirring hope, bringing peace to us
Will sound till He appears
For He lives: Christ is risen from the dead!

[Verse 3]
One with the Father, Ancient of Days
Through the Spirit who clothes faith with certainty
Honor and blessing, glory and praise
To the King crowned with pow’r and authority
And we are raised with Him
Death is dead, love has won, Christ has conquered
And we shall reign with Him
For He lives: Christ is risen from the dead!",4976227,en,en,en,4cN0y7gQdR6HubpS3wX5Yl

there was something you were missing
what if i told you that Jesus
doesn’t really fit into your description
what if i told you that “Follower of Christ” doesn’t automatically mean “Christian”

doesn’t mean Jesus didn’t believe in submission

you say Jesus was God
and that God had descended

Islamic Concept of Jesus

Islamic Concept of God

(The Verse of the Throne - Surah Baqara, Verse 255
Allah - La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists.
Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him.
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth.

Who is he that can intercede with Him except with his Permission?

He knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter.
And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills.
His Kursi (Throne) extends over the heavens and the earth and He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.)


our God is all Great
and cannot be comprehended
you say that God was Murdered
or do you believe that he pretended

see God gave us brains
and God gave us logic
but i guess God wanted us to use them in everything else except for this topic

it’s like wearing a cross and proclaiming that you love Jesus
when if God was murdered on the Cross, the cross really shouldn’t please
us
i mean would you be wearing an axe if it was used to chop your mother up into pieces
see this is what happens when you believe in faith
but fail to believe in reason
see we used to worship the Creator
until Satan turned us to the Creation
we began to worship the people
and neglect the one who made them
we began to believed that God had died
but how could a God even be created?

a Miraculous birth
and therefore “the son of God was begotten”
see the creation of Jesus was easy
but you seem to have forgotten
that God says Be

Holy Quran
Surah Ali ‘Imran (Family of Imran) 3:59

(Verily, the likeness of Iesa (Jesus) before Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: “Be!” - and he was.)


and it is, just like with Adam
a concept to complex for the church to merely fathom

for He Was The Creator of the Universe, for all we know even More
and So What
if we can’t see him, i mean what you acting like our universe is small
i mean there still so much we’re still yet to explore
i mean there’s still so many things as human beings we still haven’t
seen
touched
heard
or saw
i mean our eyes can’t even handle the sight of the Sun
so how can we possibly handle the sight of our Lord….
see Jesus used to pray


…Read…
Gospel of Mathew 26:39
(And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.)


but in your opinion who did he pray too
i mean if Jesus was God
surely prayer would be of no use
or did he only require it, when he needed to know the truth
like when God, wasn’t sure whether it was the season of the fruit


…Watch…
Gospel of Mark 11:12-14
(And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:
And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.
And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.)


Gospel of John 5:30
(I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.)


Surah As-Saf (The Ranks) - 61:6
And [mention] when Jesus, the son of Mary, said, “O children of Israel, indeed I am the messenger of Allah to you confirming what came before me of the Torah and bringing good tidings of a messenger to come after me, whose name is Ahmad.” But when he came to them with clear evidences, they said, “This is obvious magic.”)


or maybe he prayed, when there was something he couldn’t do
like when he said “i of myself can do nothing”
but you took it as “there’s nothing he couldn’t do”

see no one used to worship Jesus
so ask yourself why do you?
a concept so straight forward
but has left so many confused

see Jesus preached one God
but the Church has failed to practice


…Watch…
The Book of Isaiah 45:5
(I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me)


Surah Al-Ma’idah (The Table Spread) - 5:116-120
And [beware the Day] when Allah will say, “O Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, 'Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah ?’” He will say, “Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen.

I said not to them except what You commanded me - to worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I was among them; but when You took me up, You were the Observer over them, and You are, over all things, Witness.

If You should punish them - indeed they are Your servants; but if You forgive them - indeed it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.

Allah will say, ""This is the Day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness.” For them are gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever, Allah being pleased with them, and they with Him. That is the great attainment.

To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is within them. And He is over all things competent)


and i mean you don’t have to be that dumb to know that
one
plus one
plus one equalling one isn’t necessarily gonna give you a pass in mathematics

see the church said, three
when Jesus said, One

NB: This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim.

(But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.)


but you’ve chosen to worship Jesus, despite everything he used to say
you began to think with your emotion
and forgot to think with your mind
i guess you didn’t pay attention when Jesus says our father
yet never says Mine


…Watch…
Book of Mathew 6:9
NB: This video is private.

(After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.)


you claim to be a follower of Christ
yet you still choose to eat swine


…Watch…
The Book of Deuteronomy 14:8
(And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.)


and you call yourselves Christians but in your churches you’re busy drinking wine


…Watch…
The Book of Leviticus 10:9-11
(Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:
And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;
And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.)


and just to clarify
i do love Jesus
matter fact i love him more than you
because when Jesus said do Something
i actually do

however, i’m not connected with the church nor with the bible
see i love Jesus as my Prophet, but refuse to worship him as an idol
just like he wanted….
and proclaimed it as sin


…Read…
The Book of Exodus 20:4
(Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth)


so it doesn’t really matter if they don’t let him in, because Jesus wouldn’t even wanna be in the presence of people worshipping an idol
of him


…Voiceover…

the worshipping of Jesus

“Giant Jesus is no more.”


is a man made invention
he never asked for your worship so he can grant you protection
rather he asked you to alternate your prayers towards another direction


…Voiceover…
“Allahu Akbar..Allahu Akbar.”
(God is the Greatest..God is the Greatest.)


to God and God only
and pray that he accepts them
and know that just because you love Jesus
doesn’t mean he feels the same way about your affection

see what you believe in, is exactly what he resented
matter fact it’s everything he despised
see the worshipping of creation goes against the very “message” he supplied

so you began to follow a religion
and called it “love” in disguise
because love can be good
but love can be blind

Who made anthems
Who made bangers
Dawg, I rest my case


Entered the goat convo
I hit them up with a two piece combo
A funky beat
And poetic lyrics
I’m not scared of what they be fearing
Who dropped albums
And went on an incredible run
Whose power level over 9000
Worked hard
When they said, “Zoan you a bum”
I’m having fun
I know that my potential is endless
The folly seems persuasive
The schemes are calculated
But I brought the world to its senses
I’m the sensei
I’m the supplier
I’m good with my place in the game
I’ll be better when I choose to retire

Who spoke of the Kingdom
When everyone was chasing clout
Who gave you clarity and peace
When y’all mind was shrouded with doubt
Who allowed
Peasants to become Kings
Who’s all about unifying the people
Who gave
Kids at Podowon songs to sing
Who dismantled the hatred and the evil
Dawg, my legacy
Is like mint chocolate chip ice cream
Dawg, my influence
Got ragtags of misfits
Wanting to join my team
My high beam
Lets the blind see ever oh so clearly
I give food for thought to those who are starving
I provide a safe haven for those whose soul is weary",6432761,en,en,en,

Sniffing cocaine with somebody's kid
All the shit I did, that's a memory
Raping tape decks, Memorex don't forget shit
Straight up, who want to battle me?
I'm on drugs, talking about your family

Backhand your dad for acting like a fag

Package wack rappers like gifts on Christmas

And for making up my own bed this week, one dollar
For going to the store, fifty cents

Doctored and prayed for you, no charge

1 Kings 2,misc,ESV Bible,2017,5,{},"David's Instructions to Solomon

1 When David's time to die drew near, he commanded Solomon his son, saying,
2 “I am about to go the way of all the earth. Be strong, and show yourself a man,
3 and keep the charge of the Lord your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, his commandments, his rules, and his testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn,
4 that the Lord may establish his word that he spoke concerning me, saying, ‘If your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk before me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul, you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.’

5 “Moreover, you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, how he dealt with the two commanders of the armies of Israel, Abner the son of Ner, and Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, avenging in time of peace for blood that had been shed in war, and putting the blood of war on the belt around his waist and on the sandals on his feet.
6 Act therefore according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace.
7 But deal loyally with the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table, for with such loyalty they met me when I fled from Absalom your brother.
8 And there is also with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse on the day when I went to Mahanaim. But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the Lord, saying, ‘I will not put you to death with the sword.’
9 Now therefore do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man. You will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his gray head down with blood to Sheol.”

The Death of David

10 Then David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David.
11 And the time that David reigned over Israel was forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
12 So Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established.

Solomon's Reign Established
13 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, “Do you come peacefully?” He said, “Peacefully.”
14 Then he said, “I have something to say to you.” She said, “Speak.” 15 He said, “You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel fully expected me to reign. However, the kingdom has turned about and become my brother's, for it was his from the Lord.
16 And now I have one request to make of you; do not refuse me.” She said to him, “Speak.”
17 And he said, “Please ask King Solomon—he will not refuse you—to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.”
18 Bathsheba said, “Very well; I will speak for you to the king.”

19 So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. And the king rose to meet her and bowed down to her. Then he sat on his throne and had a seat brought for the king's mother, and she sat on his right.
20 Then she said, “I have one small request to make of you; do not refuse me.” And the king said to her, “Make your request, my mother, for I will not refuse you.”
21 She said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as his wife.”
22 King Solomon answered his mother, “And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also, for he is my older brother, and on his side are Abiathar the priest and Joab the son of Zeruiah.”
23 Then King Solomon swore by the Lord, saying, “God do so to me and more also if this word does not cost Adonijah his life!
24 Now therefore as the Lord lives, who has established me and placed me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death today.”
25 So King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he struck him down, and he died.

26 And to Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go to Anathoth, to your estate, for you deserve death. But I will not at this time put you to death, because you carried the ark of the Lord God before David my father, and because you shared in all my father's affliction.”
27 So Solomon expelled Abiathar from being priest to the Lord, thus fulfilling the word of the Lord that he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.

28 When the news came to Joab—for Joab had supported Adonijah although he had not supported Absalom—Joab fled to the tent of the Lord and caught hold of the horns of the altar.
29 And when it was told King Solomon, “Joab has fled to the tent of the Lord, and behold, he is beside the altar,” Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, strike him down.”
30 So Benaiah came to the tent of the Lord and said to him, “The king commands, ‘Come out.’” But he said, “No, I will die here.” Then Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, “Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.”
31 The king replied to him, “Do as he has said, strike him down and bury him, and thus take away from me and from my father's house the guilt for the blood that Joab shed without cause.
32 The Lord will bring back his bloody deeds on his own head, because, without the knowledge of my father David, he attacked and killed with the sword two men more righteous and better than himself, Abner the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah.
33 So shall their blood come back on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever. But for David and for his descendants and for his house and for his throne there shall be peace from the Lord forevermore.”
34 Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck him down and put him to death. And he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
35 The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in place of Joab, and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.
36 Then the king sent and summoned Shimei and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and dwell there, and do not go out from there to any place whatever.
37 For on the day you go out and cross the brook Kidron, know for certain that you shall die. Your blood shall be on your own head.”
38 And Shimei said to the king, “What you say is good; as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.

39 But it happened at the end of three years that two of Shimei's servants ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And when it was told Shimei, “Behold, your servants are in Gath,”
40 Shimei arose and saddled a donkey and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants. Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath.
41 And when Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and returned,
42 the king sent and summoned Shimei and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the Lord and solemnly warn you, saying, ‘Know for certain that on the day you go out and go to any place whatever, you shall die’? And you said to me, ‘What you say is good; I will obey.’ 43 Why then have you not kept your oath to the Lord and the commandment with which I commanded you?”
44 The king also said to Shimei, “You know in your own heart all the harm that you did to David my father. So the Lord will bring back your harm on your own head.
45 But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord forever.”
46 Then the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck him down, and he died.

So the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.",3270739,en,en,en,

South Coast, the wild coast, is lonely
You might win in a game at Jolon
But the lion still rules the barranca
And a man there is always alone

My name is Juan Jaro de Castro
My father was a Spanish grandee
But I won my wife in a card game
To Hell with those lords o'er the sea

I picked up the ace, I had won her
My heart, which was down at my feet
Jumped up to my throat in a hurry
Like a young summer's day she was sweet

You might win in a game at Jolon
But the lion still rules the barranca
And a man there is always alone

Her arms had to tighten around me
As we rode up thе hills from the South
Not a word did I hear from her that day
Nor a kiss from hеr pretty red mouth

We came to my cabin at twilight
The stars twinkled out on the coast
She soon loved the valley, the orchard
But I knew that she loved me the most

You might win in a game at Jolon
But the lion still rules the barranca

With crushed hip and twice-broken bone
She saddled our pony like lightnin'
And rode off in the night all alone

Buck bolted and fell on the slide
My young wife lay dead in the moonlight
My heart died that night with my bride

And we can float on like a feather

Move Along,rap,Mass of Man,2017,62,{},"[First Verse – Mass of Man]
I could break your bones like a KitKat
Never drank, never smoked, never did that
Never spit, never spoke, never hit back
All I did was I wrote and I spit crack
Call the dispatch on your bitch ass
My fist packed with gift wrap
And a gift tag to give back
And this that bullshit
Semiautomatic and I’m loaded with a full clip
Know you’ll miss, but I’ll hit that
When I skip class and I rip rap to riffraffs
How do you miss that
When the ropes around my throat, I never choke
I’ll get a better car, better house, better boat than you
Better hope I do, have hope in you
Better hope I see the Pope in you
Homie you better know it’s true
I will unleash the hulk on you
I do this for the movements, steady moving
Never losing, I’m a nuisance
Giving two cents while I’m cruising
What do you spend, yeah
What do you spend
A dollar, a nickel, a penny
Homie I’m sitting and stacking my 20’s
Never gonna quit, never gonna stop till I’m on top
And they all die, tell them all bye
Hi I’m a tall guy when I ball I
Dunk you on hoes abundance of flows
Looking at me, get a punch in the nose
Extending my arm as far as it goes
Reaching the masses with all of my flows
Sick of the people that step on my toes
Looking at me like I am a ghost
I’ll flip them the finger while reaching my goals
[Chorus – Mass of Man]
Got to keep my head up, got to keep it held high
These demons haunt me, unleash the hell fire
Move along, move along, I got somewhere to be
I’m not gonna let you hold me down, I’m making history
Got to keep my head up, got to keep it held high
These demons haunt me, unleash the hell fire
Move along, move along, I got somewhere to be
I’m not gonna let you hold me down, I’m making history

[Second Verse – The Jokerr]
I can’t tell what direction is up sometimes
Sitting on the corner while the bus runs by
Blood runs deep but blood runs dry
People disappear and loved ones die
You try to fly but you wind up backhanded
By life and you nosedive and you crash land
On the sand of an island and wind up stranded
And people that you thought would always have you back vanish
And just like that you’re alone in the darkness
The pen drips blood red ink on the parchment
Your fate sealed and you got to deal with the hardship
Alone and can never go back where you started
You know that the hate grows black in the heart
And you know that the great blow back of a spark
Is a soul that implodes and erodes into sadness
That grows into bones in the coves of the labyrinth
It’s over, everything you thought that you knew is gone
In the dust like you stomped on a crouton
Everything you fought for is pooped on
And you just get disappointed with what you bought like a groupon
You never thought that it could happen to you nah
You underestimated life bitch, boo yah
Thought you had it figured out but looked over a huge flaw
You were never in control of anything that you saw
But there you are again
Stuck in something that you wouldn’t dare be caught up in
Waiting on the answer to a prayer
Shouted in the air at God again
Does he care, no not a bit
No and even if he did, I don’t know if it even mattered
Cause this is just how I live but I still try
I’m tired of it all but regardless of how I ever feel I

[Chorus – Mass of Man]
Got to keep my head up, got to keep it held high
These demons haunt me, unleash the hell fire
Move along, move along, I got somewhere to be
I’m not gonna let you hold me down, I’m making history
Got to keep my head up, got to keep it held high
These demons haunt me, unleash the hell fire
Move along, move along, I got somewhere to be
I’m not gonna let you hold me down, I’m making history

Got to keep my head up
Got to keep it held high
These demons haunt me
I’m not gonna let you hold me down, I’m making history

Sideline,rap,David Dallas,2011,2821,{Ché-Fu},"[Verse 1]

Know the boy D-Double do it all day
Get the messing with his tracks, no foreplay
Seems simple now but it wasn't always
Used to sit up in the Pap High hallways
Teacher put me there saying that I talk to much
I thought I knew it all but I never knew much
I come to school late because my form room sucked
And we hang out by the canteen all through lunch
Young teen with a pac(men)tality
No dream I can make reality
All I care about is popularity
Trying to pass Jessica trying to get a touch
And a Mufti day try them with some new Chucks
Try them with some new Nikes or something
They didn't give a fuck about assignments or nothing
Didn't make music even though I loved it
Scared to try , high to shy get busted(?)

[Hook: Che Fu]
So I sit on the sideline
Despite in my time
If I could be in their shoes
The things that id do
But wishing won't get you know where
Dont be scared to go there
If you sit in my wake
Do it the right way
(yeah ya)

[Verse 2: David Dallas]

No I wasn't in the first fifteen
Wasn't in the choir, Never learned to sing
Couldn't play an instrument or pluck a string
Or the little rich kid whos dad bought him a car
A regular dude fading in to the background
Never took center stage, didn't really stand out
I remember school TalentQuest
We would hang out see this other dude rap
Then he'd be the man around E block
For like the next two weeks, scoring all of the chicks
While these Diggas my mom bought, are falling to bits
And I'm off in detention, for ignoring Mr. Smitts
And this bitch mocked me in class for having big lips
It was a hard knock life for a kid
Till I realized that a life isn't lived
If you're worrying about what other people might think of it
Don't sleep on this little boy's raps because he might be a hit
[Hook]

[Hook Extra: Che Fu]

Dont let it go by
There ain't no reason known why
Youre waiting around
You could be a star
Just watch from a far
Just stop waiting around

[Verse 3: David Dallas]

School finished did a little bit of growing up
But it wasn't like music was blowin' up
Shy as ever figured out I had to grow some nuts
And put my self out there, so they know whats up
And yeah I was pretty scared what they might say
They FENZ at it and say its bad in a nice way
Or I wasn't doing it the right way
But there ain't no right or wrong
Got one life to live and it ain't that long
So you gotta stay strong, gotta stay on
Another day sittin', wishin is another day gone
Another day doing dishes, or just mowing up the lawn
Coludve been another day that another star was born
[Hook]

[Outro: David Dallas]

Dont be scared man
Dont worry too much about what people are going to say
Because at the end of the day
The only person who still thinks about that stuff is you

Met a man from China, went down to Geisha Minah (A killer, a killer)

Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less, fastidious and precise

Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind

Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild

In the heat of the moment
Just to see if it's real

Tell me how it should feel

That I've got to face
So ask me just one question

There's still islands and the Orient and Temples, I'm sure
Places you go, to learn who you are
Got to keep looking
And someday I'll be in the place where I feel most like me

I could be cooking in Paris and needing nobody at all
I could move back to my hometown
Meet a good man and we'd fall in love
We'd have family and birthdays and cars
Never concerned about who we are
A life that's so stable and nice
Could it be a place where I feel most like me?

Not thinking, not worrying, just look to the sea

I do two times more than my peers could
That’s how I was raised
Livin’ double lives every single day
At the end of the night criticizing my 24
Like I should’ve did more with the hours before I lay
I’d rather die than be called lazy
In the corporate world pursuin’ my passion they called me crazy
I live my life for purpose not for paychecks
Ain’t care what I was makin’ look what I’m makin’
Don’t care how they move that’s not what I’m racin’
Define success we got two different equations
I play employed while a king ‘cause y’all know I’m like
Floyd in the ring once my flow starts to swing
I’ma voice for the ones that both dream and pursue
That’s why I’m cookin’ every day so they could feed and consume
I’m feedin’ fiends in the booth my day job’s the one that front me
No rest I double up and reinvest monthly
One foot in one foot out they tell me leave the game alone
If I really plan to grow and get that golden gramophone
But instead I’m on global panels with cameras on
While I’m out of office international with sandals on
Been on my own they amazed at what I can alone
I’d rather man it alone than be handed a loan
Hard to blend in I’m blessed to be standalone
Ain’t never been the type for someone else to get a handle on
High honors in english still talk my grammar wrong
What makes you think you could box me in
It’s ironic when critics say that it’s not for them
But when you hot they start to need you like oxygen
Hold your breath I left don’t turn right now
Been movin’ straight without you why would I turn right now?
In a one-on-one with my boss but I might write now
‘Cause Airplane Mode ain’t just a phrase it’s my lifestyle
Call Me Ace ain’t a phase that’s my life now
My life then and ‘til my lights out
What a hater gotta say they see me cause they supposed to
The difference is when I see you I don’t know you
High Grade I bow on ‘em like Ice Trae

Thanks For Nothing At All,pop,Rosemary Clooney,1962,94,{},"I'm feelin' mighty lonesome, haven't slept a wink;
I walk the floor from nine to four, in between I drink
Black coffee -- love's a hand-me-down brew
I'll never know a Sunday in this weekday room

I'm talkin to the shadow one o'clock till four
And Lord, how slow the moments go and all I do is pour
Black coffee since the blues caught my eye;
I'm hangin' out on Monday my Sunday dreams to dry

Now man is born to come a-lovin'
And a woman's born to weep and fret
To stay at home and tend her oven
And down her past regrets in coffee and cigarettes

I'm moonin' all the mornin', moanin' all the night
And in between it's nicotine and not much heart to fight
Black coffee -- feelin' low as the ground

Alphabet Soup,misc,Behan the Scene,2019,26,{},"The look on Fletcher’s dad, Mr. Garrison, was that of a killer, as the splatters of soup ran down his face. Below him laid the busted open can with the letters scattered, and the liquid scurrying across the kitchen floor.

“Fletcher!” screamed Mr. Garrison in a hoarse tone. “What a waste. This was our food for the week! Why can’t you pay attention to what you’re doing? I won’t get paid ‘till next Friday.”

Fletcher, with his head low, quickly kneeled down to pick up the can, and clean up the mess. “I’m really sorry, dad. I won’t do it again. I promise.”

“Don’t make promises you can’t keep, son. Just clean it up, I’ll figure something out” replied Mr. Garrison. Fletcher nodded. The Garrisons were a rather small family. It was just the two of them after Fletcher’s mom left to live with her boss. It’s been three years since then.

The next day, Mr. Garrison put on his crinkled jumpsuit, along with the boots that’s soles were about to fall off, and the reflective vest. Approaching the pickup truck, he noticed a parking ticket on the dashboard. It said, “46.2-1157; Expired inspection sticker. Please replace.” He didn’t notice that it was there last night when he came home from his shift. Disquieted, he crumbled it up and got inside the truck. He opened up the glove compartment, carelessly throwing it in, slamming the hatch with a solid thud. When he arrived at the construction site, he noticed the lot was half empty, and his coworkers packing their belongings.

“Where’s everyone going, w-what’s happening here?” said Mr. Garrison.
Rodney, a friend of his, sighed unconfidently, “The contractor doesn’t seem to think we’re doing a good enough job so they’re hiring someone else. We’re out of luck, Al.  That was our work for the month and you know opportunities like these are scarce around this area.” Mr. Garrison knew the situation was hanging in the balance. He got back in his car, rushing down the road to get home.

Meanwhile, Fletcher scanned the cabinets over for a third time, still unsuccessful in finding something to eat. He looked inside the trash can, staring at the wasted alphabet soup.
Tempted to take it back out, he looked around for any company. He thought he was in the clear, so he quickly went to reach for it when a hand grabbed his wrist. It was Mr. Garrison.

“What do you think you are doing?” he lightly murmured.
Fletcher immediately talked back distraught, “I need to eat something. I can’t keep skipping meals.” Mr. Garrison offered a rebuttal, “I don’t work as hard as I do for you to be eating out of a trash can. Didn’t I say I’ll figure something out?”

Fletcher turned away from him, walking towards the screen door of the trailer. Mr. Garrison had always said that to him. It’s as if he was an automated answering machine.
“We can’t keep living like this, I’ma go skim the streets for some compassionate people.” Fletcher opened the door as two peculiar gentlemen greeted him. “Your pops home, kid? We just need to speak with him”.

“Yeah. He’s inside, literally right around the corner,” said Fletcher. He then shoved his way past the men, stuffed his hands in the pocket of his hoodie, and marched off towards the main road with them staring him down.

After what seemed like an endless strip of double yellow lines and asphalt, Fletcher soon arrived at the Marketplace on top of the hill. While strolling past the area the homeless sleep in, he noticed it was unattended. In his mind, he knew it wasn’t right, but he grabbed the paper cup anyway

“This’ll do,” Fletcher said to himself. He walked a couple stores over before passing a sign that read, “Alphabet soup! Starting at $1.79 each, or 2 for $1.” He wasn’t fond of it, but he had to eat something, and that humdrum of a liquid was the only food he could afford, let alone trust. He sat down against the wall near the automatic doors and held out the cup. Each time someone passed he was ignored.

They must assume I’m trying to buy cigarettes or somethin’. But I’m only 13, he thought to himself. As time elapsed, his stomach began to sound like bidders at an auction.

Fletcher threw the cup out into the street, watching it roll away from him. Next, he speed walked into the store. He gandered at the assorted goods. They looked like prizes sitting atop a shelf in a carnival game. They had one thing in common, though: they were all tagged. That ruled out trying to steal them, but he needed something to bring home. Fletcher probed the soup cans in the isle. There were so many types, but he was only used to the alphabet kind. He used to play with letters, rearranging them into words. There were days he assembled welcoming words, and others to give a hint. Today was an ordinary one for him. He didn’t want to fiddle around so he pulled out his pockets from his sweatpants, only to find a button and some lint. Smacking his lips, his desperation got the best of him and he put the cans in his pocket, hoping to go undetected.
On the other hand, Mr. Garrison was still held up by the two gentlemen at the trailer.

“Mr. Garrison, you do know you got a lot of parking tickets you haven’t paid right?” said the two men.
“Yes, I do. I just haven’t had the money for it.” The two men, who were officers, frowned as the wrinkles in their foreheads appeared.
“You haven’t had the money for 7 years, Mr. Garrison.”

“Really? Has it really been that long?” said Mr. Garrison. Fletcher was footsteps away from exiting the mart, before a hand grabbed his wrist again. He assumed it was his father at first, but this time it was a taller guy, with hipsters’ glasses and a nametag large enough to be a billboard. It was the manager.

“And what do you plan on doing with those cans, young man?”
“I-I-I-was gonna pay for it, I-I promise. I swear,” said Fletcher.
“Oh you was gonna pay for it? You can pay for it in my office. Follow me.” Fletcher followed the manger into his office, as he was prompted to sit down. “As protocol, we have to report this to the police department. I’m sure all they’ll do is keep you in holding. but you make yourself comfortable.” Fletcher was covered in sweat. His body temperature grew tropical, and his legs were going numb. When the police came, they transferred the information into their system before taking him to the station. Mr. Garrison, with fines too massive to pay, was taken there as well.

When the police officers arrived at the station with Mr. Garrison, they aggressively uncuffed him, ordering him to sit down in the holding cell.  Mr. Garrison, beard scruffed up and cloaked in ash, abruptly and repeatedly bumped his head against the pale, brick wall. He then panned his attention. Within his peripheral vision he noticed his son in the far left corner of the hall. Suddenly jumping up, he squeezed the life out of the copper bars. Fletcher followed. After dramatic sequences ensued, they were both taken into the interrogation room.

“It says here that, with your current income, you live paycheck to paycheck, don’t you?” a man in a simplistic buttoned shirt said. “So, why alphabet soup?”
Fletcher responded in a lighthearted manner, “Why not alphabet soup? It was the cheapest thing in the store, so I thought, it wouldn’t hurt anything.”

The man smiled, “But there are other ways, you know.” Mr. Garrison looked at Fletcher oddly, then the man.

“What did my son do this time?” This wasn’t Fletcher’s first offense. As a matter of fact, he usually gets away with it.
“He tried to steal some soup,” the man said.

“Oh,” said Mr. Garrison. “That’s it? You’re kind of late to the party”
Trying to act surprised, the man went through various procedural questions. Eventually, the questions progressively became ones of his own. Mr. Garrison stood up, aggravated, with this hair frizzled.
“Do not think you are excluded, Mr. Garrison. Based on your current status, we believe foster care is Fletcher’s best interest,” said the man.

“But he’s my son, and I have a right. Nobody can take him away from me,” said Mr. Fletcher. The man chuckled into tears.

“Correct. Nobody but the court. The one in which you will be in on Monday.” When the day came, Mr. Garrison knew what was going to happen. He received the paper that spelled out words he did not want to accept.

“At least he’s not eating alphabet soup anymore,” said Mr. Garrison.",4461625,en,en,en,

William Shakespeare’s “Juliets speech in Act IV scene iii” Group 14,misc,William Shakespeare,2015,41,{},"JULIET
Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
That almost freezes up the heat of life:
I'll call them back again to comfort me:
Nurse! What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.

Laying down her dagger

What if it be a poison, which the friar
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
Because he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,--
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
Environed with all these hideous fears?
And madly play with my forefather's joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

Let the Mystery Be,rock,Bun E. Carlos,2016,25,{Xeno},"[Verse 1]
Everybody is wondering what and where we all come from
Everybody is worried about where we’re gonna go when the whole things done
But no one knows for certain that’s why it’s all the same to me
Me I just let the mystery be
Some say once you’re gone you’re gone forever
Some say you’re coming back
Some say you’re left in the arm of the savior and the sin ways of your life
Some say they’re coming back in a garden bunch of carrots or sweet peas
I think I’ll just let the mystery be

[Verse 2]
Tey’re going to a place called glory I ain’t saying anything
But I’ve had them on the the road to purgatory and I don’t like the sound of that
I believe in loving in my life I [?]

When a peace of mind can never be found?

I ran too close to the sun
I flied too high
The threshold of life is too fragile
I'm fragmented and lost

My blood still runs
But it feels too cold
Should I give up, give up, give up?
Should I be gone?

With the last breath of my soul, I'll be blessing you

Imagine born in a place, where you get beat up to you can't feel your face
All you got it hope all you, grace
When you got a government kill its own race
Lord I'm grateful for we are alive, my family and I
You helped us survive
The struggle the hunger, we just strived
June 09/06 is the day we arrived
Now I'm in area now I'm in america
Now I'm on the mic and in ready for the camera
Lights camera action gotta passion for rapping
African boy you could tell by the accent
I don't need a studio I rap it in my room
The sky ain't the limit cause im aming for the moon
J to the K we coming out soon cause we working all hard, man we hotter than june
And this is my sweat, my tears my blood
I do overflow when I speak I flood
I hope you understand I was raised in the mud
And this is my story ain't a life off a thug
I'm never looking back cause the future much brighter
Ive through it all man, imma soul survivor
Lord knows I rose like the Pied Piper
Hip Hop won't fade cause I'm holding up my lighter

James [Verse]

Close your eyes and imagine
A little boy rapping, everybody is clapping
A face full of joy, and the toe
Keeps tapping, its magic
In a city filled with tragic, pathetic!
Boom with the talent, lived trapped in the Valley
Glazed at the mountains, and rapped in the alleys
Ballet to the pad and he waited for his dad
Visa in his hand soon he left his homeland
Abhinaya is the name and I'm boosting up the lane
Hip hop needs a lift and we could be the crane
They frown, and grin, and hate within, but...
Does it really matter about the color of my skin???
Got the fighter's ambition, the sun is the mission
Grind all day so I'm hot with the friction
Shot from the riffle
Haters need a NyQuil
Still got my eyes on the money like geico

Grief Point,rock,Destroyer,2010,1020,{Loscil},"The journal starts late: six weeks into the making of ""Grief Point,"" first off is ""May Day,"" a song in honor of May 1st and the workers. Can you still be against the strike that only strikes for more pay? By ""you,"" in this instance, I mean ""me.""

There is a certain kind of person to whom things come with great facility. They say this is the noise that gets made as my life is lived. So be it. But don't feel the need to record it. For a second I thought that this meant that they were not interested in history. But that's...wrong. Wrong, wrong. A bad reading of the situation. The right reading is that I just don't understand it. At all

Grief Point — and ""May Day,"" by extension — suffers from the same old shit. A potential, complete ignorance of ambience, real ambience, in that: Can you really construct it, every last bit of it, and just let the listener feel its effects? And is this the right treatment? Always the same question. In this case I would maybe say yes, just because it forces form onto the thing, ""thing"" as a bunch of words, two melodies, and the words sung in a handful of ways. Between J____ and D____, of course, the same old war rages: one into a tight and perfect digital palace, but super true to the genre; the other, wanting to draw on actual sounds, mix it up, humanize

It's cool how for my part, this sleight of hand, the trick of making something confounding and great and potentially horrible, drawn up from air--all this is no longer of any interest. In fact, even seeing things in this light depresses me. And so I often come home at night depressed by what we have done, what we are doing. It's good. It means I've changed

I have lost interest in music. It is horrible

I should only make things I understand. I should only make things I know how to construct, however imperfect. It's not even like dictating to someone. It's less than that

""May Day"" itself is pretty cool, I have to admit. It condemns the world at such an easy pace. I intend to tell T____ it is like a happy ""Shooting Rockets,"" a disgusting description of anything, to be sure. I think the world does not like me grim. It likes me melancholic, but not miserable. English on the Mediterranean, which is oddly enough some of the worst people there is

At some point, when it is made, I will explain this record, word for word, swear to God. An ape with angel glands: when I know if it is good or bad, I'll know what is good, and what is bad

The answer to the making of ""Grief Point"" is picnic baskets filled with blood

Too rich, nothing at stake

If ______ had to write lyrics for his songs, they would be cumbersome, pale blocks, like his riffs, but pale. So instead he went out and found a wailer, too stupid to commit to a single thing
I assume not lighting up at the sight of your mother is a sign of madness in an infant. Patina, no name for a baby. Your firstborn, before they threw you from the bridge

Bagna wrestles his dogs to the floor. Such a beautiful scene for some. They write plays, don't perform them

The message from the critical reception of Dreams was quite clear: we will not be listening to you any further. Of course some tension is created. Cosmonaut in a bread line, et cetera

I watched a pig devour the classics just to get to you. The barge endlessly circling, your mind finds out. It is done",2299030,en,en,en,1KGRiZxua3BO58aRErRxyd
Reflections on the 20th Anniversary of the Zapatistas Excerpts,misc,Subcommandante Marcos,2013,10,{},"Rebellion is not exclusive to the Neo-Zapatistas. It is for all of humanity. And that’s something to celebrate. Everywhere, every day and every hour. For rebellion is also a celebration...

The criminals of the Mexican political class that have badly governed these lands will always remain to those who suffered their outrages, unpunished criminals. No matter how many scripted lines are are paid for in the media, or how much is spent on spectacles in the streets, in newspapers, on radio and television...

What have they done so that working in media is of labor of pride that does not result in the loss of liberty or a life of honesty? Can they say that their work is more respected by rulers and those ruled now than 20 years ago? What have they done against imposed and tolerated censorship? Can they say that their readers-listeners-viewers are better informed now than 20 years ago? Can they say that they are more credible now than 20 years ago?...

You don’t get chills when perhaps, in the future Carlos Salinas de Gortari will be known as ‘the visionary’ who understood that selling a nation was not only just a family business but an act of modern patriotism, and not the leader of a band of traitors?...

This is Zapatista territory, it is Chiapas, it is Mexico, it Latin America, it is Earth. And it is December 2013, it is as cold now as 20 years ago and, as then, a flag shelters us today: one of rebellion.",327518,en,en,en,

I get, I get, I, I, I get so deep in that pussy
I touch the back of your soul
You gotta man, I bet I can make you pack up and roll
Yea, let's ride like we attached to the road
And if we on the same track, I hope we crash and explode

Yea, where do the passionate go
I beat it up forever, girl I'll take a national oath
Nobody knows what goes on the latch on the door
And if you throw it to me baby, I will catch it and score
Yea, yea
I beat that, I be right when she call me
She got that shit I just can't avoid
She so addictive and she know that
I do anything that she tell me
I am her personal sex toy

And then I pop the bottle of that Cris
I had a glass, she had a glass
I had a glass, she had a glass, again
Ya know, then she was ready got to it
One time, two times, hit me up
And I take that ass again and I told her

You got me sweatin' you so hard, I'm 'bout to pass out
And we could do it on the beach, in the grass house
Say, we could do it on the beach, in my glass house

Uh huh, I know what I'm doin', I'm on it until the mornin'
Hop on it until it's foamin', I bone it better than homie
I want it better than homie, come get on this pony
I put my name on it, I own it

That's right, pin ya to the wall, give ya couple of back bites
Give ya couple of thigh bites, then here comes the highlight
I could make ya act right
Take a ten minute break, then get back right

Yea, I told her, ya mama gotta be a model or somethin'
And if you was a wine bottle, I'm drunk
She dance on me like it's just us girl
You could make a nigga pay ya rent for 6 months

Shh, I ain't lyin' girl
I could make ya little pussy start cryin' girl
You won't fire girl
You know the fireman could put out the fire girl

Are those apple bottom jeans ya wearin'?
She said these is Donna Karen
So tight, she can't even let air in
Man, I swear I saw a blind man starin'

No lie and I hope she take her clothes off
So we can do it, 'til we doze off
We fall asleep with our clothes off
When we wake up, we pick up where we left off

Everyman,rap,Pete Rock & Deda,2003,202,{},"[Verse 1] Deda
To make long story short kill the thought of dissin' me
You can keep your jealousy you can't get the best of me
Stressin' me and pressin' me to flip the script
So watch your lip before I bust it open
Slip and get your butt whipped like cream
Pa comes clean with the real and what i'm feelin'
I'm dealin' with a nigga that wants me out the picture
Beef goes down every time I roll with yas
So I give 'em and inch and they wanna take a mile
They talk behind your back and in your face they wanna smile
Jerks can smirk when i bodyslam a shamma
To think you was cool and you thought that you overruled
Check it, the enemy is easily spotted, you got it
And definitely on some booger snot shit
Watch it cause it's not good for your health
Check the rhyme ya'll it's every man for himself

[Verse 2] Pete Rock
I don't want to talk to ya story as you walkin'
This is especially for the niggas that be hawkin'
I'm worth six mil like the nigga Steve Austin
I can see a phony man layin' in a coffin
Surrounded by jealousy and envy every day
Where I work, where I play, it's like I can't get away
So like a matinee I view danger
No stranger to the ghetto I know the streets are full of anger
In a new time zone you gots to hold your own
Check the monotone  as I drop jewels on you fools
I see right through no loyalty in the crew
I can count on one hand who's my man and it's very few
Smile in my face behind my back you talk trash
That shit don't last so put a quarter in ya ass
And being self centered is really bad for your health
Ah man fuck it it's every man for himself
[Verse 3] Deda
Solid like stone with the pound when I come around
40s on the ground just listening to the sound
Only peeps that I swung with in the whole town
Everybody's down till I got shot by this clown
I got your back in fact I got the gat
I remember but when it was on where was my back at?
I'm jus there to let niggas know
Friendships are based on behavior when you flow
I know I'm hated and faggots perpetrated
But they still on the dick from the shit I illustrated, ill fated
Not I play my cards like a champ and when it's time I push power on the amp

[Pete Rock]
So put a stamp on ya dome 'cause now the spot in blown
To another dimension like the twilight zone
Heads are flown as I proceed to take the lead and not even feed into the greed, so let's plant the seed
And know who your peoples are
And keep your cypher tight and know who's wrong from right
It's time to resign and put your rhymes on the shelf
I'm keepin' it real it's every man for himself",4184946,en,en,en,0K9AvOOYyS8pHjNEbo8z8Z

We knew each other for years, have partied together
The world was ours and we didn't need money for it
We simply let ourselves drift, we didn't wanna miss everything
We didn't wanna become like the people that we hate
Just one look from you and I knew exactly, what you think, what you feel
This great trust among women blew me away
It was clear to me that I could always count on you
No party without us, always in the middle
Where live is without any rеstriction
That time was awesome, wе were game for anything
And when I think about it today and it screams deep within me
I’m sorry that I haven’t been more strict with you

You're gambling with time and you know you just can't win
But still you feel that somehow you've just got to keep on trying
And woman, it's your heart, I hear crying

Now the young man by your side is your husband, or so you say
In reality, he's a link with a past you just can't replace
You tell the world you're happy when you're lying in his arms
Oh but his youth has made you hate to see his face
And woman, it's your heart, I see crying

Now you're standing like some tree oh and the blossom has blown away
And the last leaf has gone crumbling, tumbling towards the ground

Except to keep on telling me about all the happiness that you do think you have found

Stick this business, stock me up, they took my coat with a stun gun
On a Sunday, a bloody Sunday, so what's the resume?
Heads got felt in the force, I heard a Milky Way
I caught a heart attack when I heard my cousin duck hunt
In Avenue D, in Brooklyn, New York City

I take a ruff-neck chicken make stop in stone top
'Cause I roll with the army of sixty-eight
The Privates' don't make the orders, it's the General that makes the wig-wack
Buy her back, buy a cat, I got scratched in a day to kidnap
And at night, I was back and the Jeep, got attacked by a gang that sold crack
But the posse was strapped, it was nothin' but crap
I got cuffed in the back, in the jail there were rats
So I pulled out my mack to get out of this crap
Though I wish I could zap outta here, but I quack like a dog
That pass gas, so I put the gas mask on the mic
There were blasts, 'cause I do it, it's my task
And all the jumper the guys that I see to me pass the class

Easier said than what the mono said
'Cause there's more than righter rapper, paid for the rapper be-bop
'Cause he said everybody's rappin', them and they momma
So when I grab the mic, I grab it like a gangster
Microphone sniper, 'cause it'll be the prowler
Launch it, it's trife, no magic, the realistic maggot
Don't leave the gadget or you'll be gat it
Simple, the riddle, who's the monkey in the middle
What's the goose, um
So let me cut his neck loose, yo
I keep it positive and not so negative
These is when you diss, emcees take it
So send it to they call the battle
I'ma raw I let it rappin', now I'm more
Your ball, you're waitin' for me to fall, but I won't stop

So how hard is it? (Hard as it can get)
I wanna know, how hard do you wanna it? (Hard as it can get)

[Verse 4: Lauryn Hill & Wyclef Jean]
I gotta jump on the A-Train, I saw cat with a scat, he was blowin' like Coltrane
My boys said: ""Give him a call"", I gave him a dollar, he said: ""Are you a rapper?""
Kids have a seat and don't miss a beat, and listen to the battle of the saxin' in your emcee
Now Red Rock, call Red Rock, call Red Rock, call Red Rock, call Red Rock call
(It could mean rewind the gun-check me, baby)
I rock and shock the dough is show squeeze and cheese and whether pleasin'
(It could mean rewind the gun-check me, baby)

Night,misc,Madison Cawein,1887,6,{},"Lo! where the car of Day down slopes of flame
On burnished axle quits the drowsy skies!
And as his snorting steeds of glowing brass
Rush 'neath the earth, a glimmering dust of gold
From their fierce hoofs o'er heaven's azure meads
Rolls to yon star that burns beneath the moon.
With solemn tread and holy-stoled, star-bound,
The Night steps in, sad votaress, like a nun,
To pace lone corridors of th' ebon-archéd sky.
How sad! how beautiful! her raven locks
Pale-filleted with stars that dance their sheen
On her deep, holy eyes, and woo to sleep,
Sleep or the easeful slumber of white Death!
How calm o'er this great water, in its flow
Silent and vast, smoothes yon cold sister sphere,
Her lucid chasteness feathering the wax-white foam!
As o'er a troubled brow falls calm content:
As clear-eyed chastity in this bleak world
Tinges and softens all the darker dross.

See, where the roses blow at the wood's edge
In many a languid bloom, bowed to the moon
And the dim river's lisp; sleep droops their lids
With damask lashes trimmed and fragile rayed,
Which the mad, frolic bee—rough paramour—
So often kissed beneath th' enlivening sun.
How cool the breezes touch the tired head
With unseen fingers long and soft! and there
From its white couch of thorn-tree blossoms sweet,
Pillowed with one milk cluster, floating, swooning,
Drops the low nocturne of a dreaming bird,
Ave Maria, nun-like, slumb'ring sung.
See, there the violet mound in many an eye,
A deep-blue eye, meek, delicate, and sad,
As Sorrow's own sad eyes, great with far dreams,
When haltingly she bends o'er Lethe's waves
Falt'ring to drink, and falt'ring still remains,
The Night with feet of moon-tinged mist swept o'er
Them now, but as she passed she bent and kissed
Each modest orb that selfless hung as tho'
Thought-freighted low; then groped her train of jet
Which billowing by did merely waft the sound
Of a brief gust to each wild violet,
To kiss each eye and laugh; then shed a tear
Upon each downward face which nestled there.
She weeping from her silent vigil turns,
As some pale mother from her cradled child,
Frail, sick, and wan, with kisses warm and songs
Wooed to a peaceful ease and tranquil rest,

There, out in the darkness
A fugitive running
Fallen from God
Fallen from grace
God be my witness
I never shall yield
Till we come face to face
Till we come face to face

He knows his way in the dark
Mine is the way of the Law
Those who follow the path of the righteous
Shall have their reward
And if they fall as Lucifer fell
The flames
The sword!

Stars
In your multitudes
Scarce to be counted
Filling the darkness
With order and light
You are the sentinels
Silent and sure
Keeping watch in the night
Keeping watch in the night
You know your place in the sky
You hold your course and your aim
And each in your season
Returns and returns
And is always the same
And if you fall as Lucifer fell
You fall in flame!

And so it must be, for so it is written
On the doorway to paradise
That those who falter and those who fall
Must pay the price!

Lord, let me find him
That I may see him
Safe behind bars
I will never rest

Will I be forgotten or forgiven?
Will I climb back up without a care?

Lay me down and pull me out to sea
Lay me down and let it wash me clean

Silence is my choir
No one holds me like you do
Like oil and water

Verse 2
If I speak and nobody listens
How do I know if I made a sound?
If I let someone else make my decisions
Will I lose myself in the crowd?

Lay me down and pull me out to sea
Lay me down and let it wash me clean

Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man Chapter 2,rap,James Joyce,1914,1864,{},"Chapter 2

Uncle Charles smoked such black twist that at last his nephew suggested to him to enjoy his morning smoke in a little outhouse at the end of the garden

—Very good, Simon. All serene, Simon, said the old man tranquilly. Anywhere you like. The outhouse will do me nicely: it will be more salubrious

—Damn me, said Mr Dedalus frankly, if I know how you can smoke such villainous awful tobacco. It's like gunpowder, by God

—It's very nice, Simon, replied the old man. Very cool and mollifying

Every morning, therefore, uncle Charles repaired to his outhouse but not before he had greased and brushed scrupulously his back hair and brushed and put on his tall hat. While he smoked the brim of his tall hat and the bowl of his pipe were just visible beyond the jambs of the outhouse door. His arbour, as he called the reeking outhouse which he shared with the cat and the garden tools, served him also as a sounding-box: and every morning he hummed contentedly one of his favourite songs: O, TWINE ME A BOWER or BLUE EYES AND GOLDEN HAIR or THE GROVES OF BLARNEY while the grey and blue coils of smoke rose slowly from his pipe and vanished in the pure air

During the first part of the summer in Blackrock uncle Charles was Stephen's constant companion. Uncle Charles was a hale old man with a well tanned skin, rugged features and white side whiskers. On week days he did messages between the house in Carysfort Avenue and those shops in the main street of the town with which the family dealt. Stephen was glad to go with him on these errands for uncle Charles helped him very liberally to handfuls of whatever was exposed in open boxes and barrels outside the counter. He would seize a handful of grapes and sawdust or three or four American apples and thrust them generously into his grandnephew's hand while the shopman smiled uneasily; and, on Stephen's feigning reluctance to take them, he would frown and say:

—Take them, sir. Do you hear me, sir? They're good for your bowels

When the order list had been booked the two would go on to the park where an old friend of Stephen's father, Mike Flynn, would be found seated on a bench, waiting for them. Then would begin Stephen's run round the park. Mike Flynn would stand at the gate near the railway station, watch in hand, while Stephen ran round the track in the style Mike Flynn favoured, his head high lifted, his knees well lifted and his hands held straight down by his sides. When the morning practice was over the trainer would make his comments and sometimes illustrate them by shuffling along for a yard or so comically in an old pair of blue canvas shoes. A small ring of wonderstruck children and nursemaids would gather to watch him and linger even when he and uncle Charles had sat down again and were talking athletics and politics. Though he had heard his father say that Mike Flynn had put some of the best runners of modern times through his hands Stephen often glanced at his trainer's flabby stubble-covered face, as it bent over the long stained fingers through which he rolled his cigarette, and with pity at the mild lustreless blue eyes which would look up suddenly from the task and gaze vaguely into the blue distance while the long swollen fingers ceased their rolling and grains and fibres of tobacco fell back into the pouch

On the way home uncle Charles would often pay a visit to the chapel and, as the font was above Stephen's reach, the old man would dip his hand and then sprinkle the water briskly about Stephen's clothes and on the floor of the porch. While he prayed he knelt on his red handkerchief and read above his breath from a thumb blackened prayer book wherein catchwords were printed at the foot of every page. Stephen knelt at his side respecting, though he did not share, his piety. He often wondered what his grand-uncle prayed for so seriously. Perhaps he prayed for the souls in purgatory or for the grace of a happy death or perhaps he prayed that God might send him back a part of the big fortune he had squandered in Cork

On Sundays Stephen with his father and his grand-uncle took their constitutional. The old man was a nimble walker in spite of his corns and often ten or twelve miles of the road were covered. The little village of Stillorgan was the parting of the ways. Either they went to the left towards the Dublin mountains or along the Goatstown road and thence into Dundrum, coming home by Sandyford. Trudging along the road or standing in some grimy wayside public house his elders spoke constantly of the subjects nearer their hearts, of Irish politics, of Munster and of the legends of their own family, to all of which Stephen lent an avid ear. Words which he did not understand he said over and over to himself till he had learnt them by heart: and through them he had glimpses of the real world about them. The hour when he too would take part in the life of that world seemed drawing near and in secret he began to make ready for the great part which he felt awaited him the nature of which he only dimly apprehended
His evenings were his own; and he pored over a ragged translation of THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. The figure of that dark avenger stood forth in his mind for whatever he had heard or divined in childhood of the strange and terrible. At night he built up on the parlour table an image of the wonderful island cave out of transfers and paper flowers and coloured tissue paper and strips of the silver and golden paper in which chocolate is wrapped. When he had broken up this scenery, weary of its tinsel, there would come to his mind the bright picture of Marseille, of sunny trellises, and of Mercedes

Outside Blackrock, on the road that led to the mountains, stood a small whitewashed house in the garden of which grew many rosebushes: and in this house, he told himself, another Mercedes lived. Both on the outward and on the homeward journey he measured distance by this landmark: and in his imagination he lived through a long train of adventures, marvellous as those in the book itself, towards the close of which there appeared an image of himself, grown older and sadder, standing in a moonlit garden with Mercedes who had so many years before slighted his love, and with a sadly proud gesture of refusal, saying:

—Madam, I never eat muscatel grapes

He became the ally of a boy named Aubrey Mills and founded with him a gang of adventurers in the avenue. Aubrey carried a whistle dangling from his buttonhole and a bicycle lamp attached to his belt while the others had short sticks thrust daggerwise through theirs. Stephen, who had read of Napoleon's plain style of dress, chose to remain unadorned and thereby heightened for himself the pleasure of taking counsel with his lieutenant before giving orders. The gang made forays into the gardens of old maids or went down to the castle and fought a battle on the shaggy weed-grown rocks, coming home after it weary stragglers with the stale odours of the foreshore in their nostrils and the rank oils of the seawrack upon their hands and in their hair

Aubrey and Stephen had a common milkman and often they drove out in the milk-car to Carrickmines where the cows were at grass. While the men were milking the boys would take turns in riding the tractable mare round the field. But when autumn came the cows were driven home from the grass: and the first sight of the filthy cowyard at Stradbrook with its foul green puddles and clots of liquid dung and steaming bran troughs, sickened Stephen's heart. The cattle which had seemed so beautiful in the country on sunny days revolted him and he could not even look at the milk they yielded

The coming of September did not trouble him this year for he was not to be sent back to Clongowes. The practice in the park came to an end when Mike Flynn went into hospital. Aubrey was at school and had only an hour or two free in the evening. The gang fell asunder and there were no more nightly forays or battles on the rocks. Stephen sometimes went round with the car which delivered the evening milk and these chilly drives blew away his memory of the filth of the cowyard and he felt no repugnance at seeing the cow hairs and hayseeds on the milkman's coat. Whenever the car drew up before a house he waited to catch a glimpse of a well scrubbed kitchen or of a softly lighted hall and to see how the servant would hold the jug and how she would close the door. He thought it should be a pleasant life enough, driving along the roads every evening to deliver milk, if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of gingernuts in his pocket to eat from. But the same foreknowledge which had sickened his heart and made his legs sag suddenly as he raced round the park, the same intuition which had made him glance with mistrust at his trainer's flabby stubble-covered face as it bent heavily over his long stained fingers, dissipated any vision of the future. In a vague way he understood that his father was in trouble and that this was the reason why he himself had not been sent back to Clongowes. For some time he had felt the slight change in his house; and those changes in what he had deemed unchangeable were so many slight shocks to his boyish conception of the world. The ambition which he felt astir at times in the darkness of his soul sought no outlet. A dusk like that of the outer world obscured his mind as he heard the mare's hoofs clattering along the tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great can swaying and rattling behind him

He returned to Mercedes and, as he brooded upon her image, a strange unrest crept into his blood. Sometimes a fever gathered within him and led him to rove alone in the evening along the quiet avenue. The peace of the gardens and the kindly lights in the windows poured a tender influence into his restless heart. The noise of children at play annoyed him and their silly voices made him feel, even more keenly than he had felt at Clongowes, that he was different from others. He did not want to play. He wanted to meet in the real world the unsubstantial image which his soul so constantly beheld. He did not know where to seek it or how, but a premonition which led him on told him that this image would, without any overt act of his, encounter him. They would meet quietly as if they had known each other and had made their tryst, perhaps at one of the gates or in some more secret place. They would be alone, surrounded by darkness and silence: and in that moment of supreme tenderness he would be transfigured

He would fade into something impalpable under her eyes and then in a moment he would be transfigured. Weakness and timidity and inexperience would fall from him in that magic moment

Two great yellow caravans had halted one morning before the door and men had come tramping into the house to dismantle it. The furniture had been hustled out through the front garden which was strewn with wisps of straw and rope ends and into the huge vans at the gate. When all had been safely stowed the vans had set off noisily down the avenue: and from the window of the railway carriage, in which he had sat with his red-eyed mother, Stephen had seen them lumbering along the Merrion Road

The parlour fire would not draw that evening and Mr Dedalus rested the poker against the bars of the grate to attract the flame. Uncle Charles dozed in a corner of the half furnished uncarpeted room and near him the family portraits leaned against the wall. The lamp on the table shed a weak light over the boarded floor, muddied by the feet of the van-men. Stephen sat on a footstool beside his father listening to a long and incoherent monologue. He understood little or nothing of it at first but he became slowly aware that his father had enemies and that some fight was going to take place. He felt, too, that he was being enlisted for the fight, that some duty was being laid upon his shoulders. The sudden flight from the comfort and revery of Blackrock, the passage through the gloomy foggy city, the thought of the bare cheerless house in which they were now to live made his heart heavy, and again an intuition, a foreknowledge of the future came to him. He understood also why the servants had often whispered together in the hall and why his father had often stood on the hearthrug with his back to the fire, talking loudly to uncle Charles who urged him to sit down and eat his dinner

—There's a crack of the whip left in me yet, Stephen, old chap, said Mr Dedalus, poking at the dull fire with fierce energy. We're not dead yet, sonny. No, by the Lord Jesus (God forgive me) not half dead

Dublin was a new and complex sensation. Uncle Charles had grown so witless that he could no longer be sent out on errands and the disorder in settling in the new house left Stephen freer than he had been in Blackrock. In the beginning he contented himself with circling timidly round the neighbouring square or, at most, going half way down one of the side streets but when he had made a skeleton map of the city in his mind he followed boldly one of its central lines until he reached the customhouse. He passed unchallenged among the docks and along the quays wondering at the multitude of corks that lay bobbing on the surface of the water in a thick yellow scum, at the crowds of quay porters and the rumbling carts and the ill-dressed bearded policeman. The vastness and strangeness of the life suggested to him by the bales of merchandise stocked along the walls or swung aloft out of the holds of steamers wakened again in him the unrest which had sent him wandering in the evening from garden to garden in search of Mercedes. And amid this new bustling life he might have fancied himself in another Marseille but that he missed the bright sky and the sum-warmed trellises of the wineshops. A vague dissatisfaction grew up within him as he looked on the quays and on the river and on the lowering skies and yet he continued to wander up and down day after day as if he really sought someone that eluded him

He went once or twice with his mother to visit their relatives: and though they passed a jovial array of shops lit up and adorned for Christmas his mood of embittered silence did not leave him. The causes of his embitterment were many, remote and near. He was angry with himself for being young and the prey of restless foolish impulses, angry also with the change of fortune which was reshaping the world about him into a vision of squalor and insincerity. Yet his anger lent nothing to the vision. He chronicled with patience what he saw, detaching himself from it and tasting its mortifying flavour in secret
He was sitting on the backless chair in his aunt's kitchen. A lamp with a reflector hung on the japanned wall of the fireplace and by its light his aunt was reading the evening paper that lay on her knees. She looked a long time at a smiling picture that was set in it and said musingly:

—The beautiful Mabel Hunter!

A ringletted girl stood on tiptoe to peer at the picture and said softly:

—What is she in, mud?

—In a pantomime, love

The child leaned her ringletted head against her mother's sleeve, gazing on the picture, and murmured as if fascinated:

—The beautiful Mabel Hunter!

As if fascinated, her eyes rested long upon those demurely taunting eyes and she murmured devotedly:

—Isn't she an exquisite creature?

And the boy who came in from the street, stamping crookedly under his stone of coal, heard her words. He dropped his load promptly on the floor and hurried to her side to see. He mauled the edges of the paper with his reddened and blackened hands, shouldering her aside and complaining that he could not see

He was sitting in the narrow breakfast room high up in the old dark-windowed house. The firelight flickered on the wall and beyond the window a spectral dusk was gathering upon the river. Before the fire an old woman was busy making tea and, as she bustled at the task, she told in a low voice of what the priest and the doctor had said. She told too of certain changes they had seen in her of late and of her odd ways and sayings. He sat listening to the words and following the ways of adventure that lay open in the coals, arches and vaults and winding galleries and jagged caverns

Suddenly he became aware of something in the doorway. A skull appeared suspended in the gloom of the doorway. A feeble creature like a monkey was there, drawn thither by the sound of voices at the fire. A whining voice came from the door asking:

—Is that Josephine?
The old bustling woman answered cheerily from the fireplace:

—No, Ellen, it's Stephen

—O... O, good evening, Stephen

He answered the greeting and saw a silly smile break over the face in the doorway

—Do you want anything, Ellen? asked the old woman at the fire

But she did not answer the question and said:

—I thought it was Josephine. I thought you were Josephine, Stephen

And, repeating this several times, she fell to laughing feebly

He was sitting in the midst of a children's party at Harold's Cross. His silent watchful manner had grown upon him and he took little part in the games. The children, wearing the spoils of their crackers, danced and romped noisily and, though he tried to share their merriment, he felt himself a gloomy figure amid the gay cocked hats and sunbonnets

But when he had sung his song and withdrawn into a snug corner of the room he began to taste the joy of his loneliness. The mirth, which in the beginning of the evening had seemed to him false and trivial, was like a soothing air to him, passing gaily by his senses, hiding from other eyes the feverish agitation of his blood while through the circling of the dancers and amid the music and laughter her glance travelled to his corner, flattering, taunting, searching, exciting his heart

In the hall the children who had stayed latest were putting on their things: the party was over. She had thrown a shawl about her and, as they went together towards the tram, sprays of her fresh warm breath flew gaily above her cowled head and her shoes tapped blithely on the glassy road

It was the last tram. The lank brown horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear night in admonition. The conductor talked with the driver, both nodding often in the green light of the lamp. On the empty seats of the tram were scattered a few coloured tickets. No sound of footsteps came up or down the road. No sound broke the peace of the night save when the lank brown horses rubbed their noses together and shook their bells

They seemed to listen, he on the upper step and she on the lower. She came up to his step many times and went down to hers again between their phrases and once or twice stood close beside him for some moments on the upper step, forgetting to go down, and then went down. His heart danced upon her movements like a cork upon a tide. He heard what her eyes said to him from beneath their cowl and knew that in some dim past, whether in life or revery, he had heard their tale before. He saw her urge her vanities, her fine dress and sash and long black stockings, and knew that he had yielded to them a thousand times. Yet a voice within him spoke above the noise of his dancing heart, asking him would he take her gift to which he had only to stretch out his hand. And he remembered the day when he and Eileen had stood looking into the hotel grounds, watching the waiters running up a trail of bunting on the flagstaff and the fox terrier scampering to and fro on the sunny lawn and how, all of a sudden, she had broken out into a peal of laughter and had run down the sloping curve of the path. Now, as then, he stood listlessly in his place, seemingly a tranquil watcher of the scene before him

—She too wants me to catch hold of her, he thought. That's why she came with me to the tram. I could easily catch hold of her when she comes up to my step: nobody is looking. I could hold her and kiss her

But he did neither: and, when he was sitting alone in the deserted tram, he tore his ticket into shreds and stared gloomily at the corrugated footboard

The next day he sat at his table in the bare upper room for many hours. Before him lay a new pen, a new bottle of ink and a new emerald exercise. From force of habit he had written at the top of the first page the initial letters of the jesuit motto: A.M.D.G. On the first line of the page appeared the title of the verses he was trying to write: To E— C—. He knew it was right to begin so for he had seen similar titles in the collected poems of Lord Byron. When he had written this title and drawn an ornamental line underneath he fell into a daydream and began to draw diagrams on the cover of the book. He saw himself sitting at his table in Bray the morning after the discussion at the Christmas dinner table, trying to write a poem about Parnell on the back of one of his father's second moiety notices. But his brain had then refused to grapple with the theme and, desisting, he had covered the page with the names and addresses of certain of his classmates:

Roderick Kickham
John Lawton
Anthony MacSwiney
Simon Moonan

Now it seemed as if he would fail again but, by dint of brooding on the incident, he thought himself into confidence. During this process all those elements which he deemed common and insignificant fell out of the scene. There remained no trace of the tram itself nor of the tram-men nor of the horses: nor did he and she appear vividly. The verses told only of the night and the balmy breeze and the maiden lustre of the moon. Some undefined sorrow was hidden in the hearts of the protagonists as they stood in silence beneath the leafless trees and when the moment of farewell had come the kiss, which had been withheld by one, was given by both. After this the letters L. D. S. were written at the foot of the page, and, having hidden the book, he went into his mother's bedroom and gazed at his face for a long time in the mirror of her dressing-table

But his long spell of leisure and liberty was drawing to its end. One evening his father came home full of news which kept his tongue busy all through dinner. Stephen had been awaiting his father's return for there had been mutton hash that day and he knew that his father would make him dip his bread in the gravy. But he did not relish the hash for the mention of Clongowes had coated his palate with a scum of disgust

—I walked bang into him, said Mr Dedalus for the fourth time, just at the corner of the square

—Then I suppose, said Mrs Dedalus, he will be able to arrange it. I mean about Belvedere

—Of course he will, said Mr Dedalus. Don't I tell you he's provincial of the order now?

—I never liked the idea of sending him to the christian brothers myself, said Mrs Dedalus

—Christian brothers be damned! said Mr Dedalus. Is it with Paddy Stink and Micky Mud? No, let him stick to the jesuits in God's name since he began with them. They'll be of service to him in after years. Those are the fellows that can get you a position

—And they're a very rich order, aren't they, Simon?

—Rather. They live well, I tell you. You saw their table at Clongowes. Fed up, by God, like gamecocks

Mr Dedalus pushed his plate over to Stephen and bade him finish what was on it

—Now then, Stephen, he said, you must put your shoulder to the wheel, old chap. You've had a fine long holiday

—O, I'm sure he'll work very hard now, said Mrs Dedalus, especially when he has Maurice with him

—O, Holy Paul, I forgot about Maurice, said Mr Dedalus. Here, Maurice! Come here, you thick-headed ruffian! Do you know I'm going to send you to a college where they'll teach you to spell c.a.t. cat. And I'll buy you a nice little penny handkerchief to keep your nose dry. Won't that be grand fun?

Maurice grinned at his father and then at his brother

Mr Dedalus screwed his glass into his eye and stared hard at both his sons. Stephen mumbled his bread without answering his father's gaze

—By the bye, said Mr Dedalus at length, the rector, or provincial rather, was telling me that story about you and Father Dolan. You're an impudent thief, he said

—O, he didn't, Simon!

—Not he! said Mr Dedalus. But he gave me a great account of the whole affair. We were chatting, you know, and one word borrowed another. And, by the way, who do you think he told me will get that job in the corporation? But I'll tell you that after. Well, as I was saying, we were chatting away quite friendly and he asked me did our friend here wear glasses still, and then he told me the whole story

—And was he annoyed, Simon?

—Annoyed? Not he! MANLY LITTLE CHAP! he said

Mr Dedalus imitated the mincing nasal tone of the provincial

Father Dolan and I, when I told them all at dinner about it, Father Dolan and I had a great laugh over it. YOU BETTER MIND YOURSELF FATHER DOLAN, said I, OR YOUNG DEDALUS WILL SEND YOU UP FOR TWICE NINE. We had a famous laugh together over it. Ha! Ha! Ha!

Mr Dedalus turned to his wife and interjected in his natural voice:

—Shows you the spirit in which they take the boys there. O, a jesuit for your life, for diplomacy!

He reassumed the provincial's voice and repeated:

—I TOLD THEM ALL AT DINNER ABOUT IT AND FATHER DOLAN AND I AND ALL OF US WE HAD A HEARTY LAUGH TOGETHER OVER IT. HA! HA! HA!

The night of the Whitsuntide play had come and Stephen from the window of the dressing-room looked out on the small grass-plot across which lines of Chinese lanterns were stretched. He watched the visitors come down the steps from the house and pass into the theatre. Stewards in evening dress, old Belvedereans, loitered in groups about the entrance to the theatre and ushered in the visitors with ceremony. Under the sudden glow of a lantern he could recognize the smiling face of a priest

The Blessed Sacrament had been removed from the tabernacle and the first benches had been driven back so as to leave the dais of the altar and the space before it free. Against the walls stood companies of barbells and Indian clubs; the dumbbells were piled in one corner: and in the midst of countless hillocks of gymnasium shoes and sweaters and singlets in untidy brown parcels there stood the stout leather-jacketed vaulting horse waiting its turn to be carried up on the stage and set in the middle of the winning team at the end of the gymnastic display

Stephen, though in deference to his reputation for essay writing he had been elected secretary to the gymnasium, had had no part in the first section of the programme but in the play which formed the second section he had the chief part, that of a farcical pedagogue. He had been cast for it on account of his stature and grave manners for he was now at the end of his second year at Belvedere and in number two

A score of the younger boys in white knickers and singlets came pattering down from the stage, through the vestry and to the chapel. The vestry and chapel were peopled with eager masters and boys. The plump bald sergeant major was testing with his foot the springboard of the vaulting horse. The lean young man in a long overcoat, who was to give a special display of intricate club swinging, stood near watching with interest, his silver-coated clubs peeping out of his deep side-pockets. The hollow rattle of the wooden dumbbells was heard as another team made ready to go up on the stage: and in another moment the excited prefect was hustling the boys through the vestry like a flock of geese, flapping the wings of his soutane nervously and crying to the laggards to make haste. A little troop of Neapolitan peasants were practising their steps at the end of the chapel, some circling their arms above their heads, some swaying their baskets of paper violets and curtsying. In a dark corner of the chapel at the gospel side of the altar a stout old lady knelt amid her copious black skirts. When she stood up a pink-dressed figure, wearing a curly golden wig and an old-fashioned straw sunbonnet, with black pencilled eyebrows and cheeks delicately rouged and powdered, was discovered. A low murmur of curiosity ran round the chapel at the discovery of this girlish figure. One of the prefects, smiling and nodding his head, approached the dark corner and, having bowed to the stout old lady, said pleasantly:

—Is this a beautiful young lady or a doll that you have here, Mrs Tallon?

Then, bending down to peer at the smiling painted face under the leaf of the bonnet, he exclaimed:

—No! Upon my word I believe it's little Bertie Tallon after all!

Stephen at his post by the window heard the old lady and the priest laugh together and heard the boys' murmurs of admiration behind him as they passed forward to see the little boy who had to dance the sunbonnet dance by himself. A movement of impatience escaped him. He let the edge of the blind fall and, stepping down from the bench on which he had been standing, walked out of the chapel

He passed out of the schoolhouse and halted under the shed that flanked the garden. From the theatre opposite came the muffled noise of the audience and sudden brazen clashes of the soldiers' band. The light spread upwards from the glass roof making the theatre seem a festive ark, anchored among the hulks of houses, her frail cables of lanterns looping her to her moorings. A side door of the theatre opened suddenly and a shaft of light flew across the grass plots. A sudden burst of music issued from the ark, the prelude of a waltz: and when the side door closed again the listener could hear the faint rhythm of the music. The sentiment of the opening bars, their languor and supple movement, evoked the incommunicable emotion which had been the cause of all his day's unrest and of his impatient movement of a moment before. His unrest issued from him like a wave of sound: and on the tide of flowing music the ark was journeying, trailing her cables of lanterns in her wake. Then a noise like dwarf artillery broke the movement. It was the clapping that greeted the entry of the dumbbell team on the stage

At the far end of the shed near the street a speck of pink light showed in the darkness and as he walked towards it he became aware of a faint aromatic odour. Two boys were standing in the shelter of a doorway, smoking, and before he reached them he had recognised Heron by his voice

—Here comes the noble Dedalus! cried a high throaty voice. Welcome to our trusty friend!

This welcome ended in a soft peal of mirthless laughter as Heron salaamed and then began to poke the ground with his cane

—Here I am, said Stephen, halting and glancing from Heron to his friend

The latter was a stranger to him but in the darkness, by the aid of the glowing cigarette tips, he could make out a pale dandyish face over which a smile was travelling slowly, a tall overcoated figure and a hard hat. Heron did not trouble himself about an introduction but said instead:

—I was just telling my friend Wallis what a lark it would be tonight if you took off the rector in the part of the schoolmaster. It would be a ripping good joke

Heron made a poor attempt to imitate for his friend Wallis the rector's pedantic bass and then, laughing at his failure, asked Stephen to do it

—Go on, Dedalus, he urged, you can take him off rippingly. HE THAT WILL NOT HEAR THE CHURCHA LET HIM BE TO THEEA AS THE HEATHENA AND THE PUBLICANA

The imitation was prevented by a mild expression of anger from Wallis in whose mouthpiece the cigarette had become too tightly wedged

—Damn this blankety blank holder, he said, taking it from his mouth and smiling and frowning upon it tolerantly. It's always getting stuck like that. Do you use a holder?

—I don't smoke, answered Stephen

—No, said Heron, Dedalus is a model youth. He doesn't smoke and he doesn't go to bazaars and he doesn't flirt and he doesn't damn anything or damn all

Stephen shook his head and smiled in his rival's flushed and mobile face, beaked like a bird's. He had often thought it strange that Vincent Heron had a bird's face as well as a bird's name. A shock of pale hair lay on the forehead like a ruffled crest: the forehead was narrow and bony and a thin hooked nose stood out between the close-set prominent eyes which were light and inexpressive. The rivals were school friends. They sat together in class, knelt together in the chapel, talked together after beads over their lunches. As the fellows in number one were undistinguished dullards, Stephen and Heron had been during the year the virtual heads of the school. It was they who went up to the rector together to ask for a free day or to get a fellow off

—O by the way, said Heron suddenly, I saw your governor going in

The smile waned on Stephen's face. Any allusion made to his father by a fellow or by a master put his calm to rout in a moment. He waited in timorous silence to hear what Heron might say next. Heron, however, nudged him expressively with his elbow and said:

—You're a sly dog

—Why so? said Stephen

—You'd think butter wouldn't melt in your mouth said Heron. But I'm afraid you're a sly dog

—Might I ask you what you are talking about? said Stephen urbanely

—Indeed you might, answered Heron. We saw her, Wallis, didn't we? And deucedly pretty she is too. And inquisitive! AND WHAT PART DOES STEPHEN TAKE, MR DEDALUS? AND WILL STEPHEN NOT SING, MR DEDALUS? Your governor was staring at her through that eyeglass of his for all he was worth so that I think the old man has found you out too. I wouldn't care a bit, by Jove. She's ripping, isn't she, Wallis?

—Not half bad, answered Wallis quietly as he placed his holder once more in a corner of his mouth

A shaft of momentary anger flew through Stephen's mind at these indelicate allusions in the hearing of a stranger. For him there was nothing amusing in a girl's interest and regard. All day he had thought of nothing but their leave-taking on the steps of the tram at Harold's Cross, the stream of moody emotions it had made to course through him and the poem he had written about it. All day he had imagined a new meeting with her for he knew that she was to come to the play. The old restless moodiness had again filled his breast as it had done on the night of the party, but had not found an outlet in verse. The growth and knowledge of two years of boyhood stood between then and now, forbidding such an outlet: and all day the stream of gloomy tenderness within him had started forth and returned upon itself in dark courses and eddies, wearying him in the end until the pleasantry of the prefect and the painted little boy had drawn from him a movement of impatience

—So you may as well admit, Heron went on, that we've fairly found you out this time. You can't play the saint on me any more, that's one sure five

A soft peal of mirthless laughter escaped from his lips and, bending down as before, he struck Stephen lightly across the calf of the leg with his cane, as if in jesting reproof

Stephen's moment of anger had already passed. He was neither flattered nor confused, but simply wished the banter to end. He scarcely resented what had seemed to him a silly indelicateness for he knew that the adventure in his mind stood in no danger from these words: and his face mirrored his rival's false smile

—Admit! repeated Heron, striking him again with his cane across the calf of the leg

The stroke was playful but not so lightly given as the first one had been. Stephen felt the skin tingle and glow slightly and almost painlessly; and, bowing submissively, as if to meet his companion's jesting mood, began to recite the CONFITEOR. The episode ended well, for both Heron and Wallis laughed indulgently at the irreverence

The confession came only from Stephen's lips and, while they spoke the words, a sudden memory had carried him to another scene called up, as if by magic, at the moment when he had noted the faint cruel dimples at the corners of Heron's smiling lips and had felt the familiar stroke of the cane against his calf and had heard the familiar word of admonition:

—Admit

It was towards the close of his first term in the college when he was in number six. His sensitive nature was still smarting under the lashes of an undivined and squalid way of life. His soul was still disquieted and cast down by the dull phenomenon of Dublin. He had emerged from a two years' spell of revery to find himself in the midst of a new scene, every event and figure of which affected him intimately, disheartened him or allured and, whether alluring or disheartening, filled him always with unrest and bitter thoughts. All the leisure which his school life left him was passed in the company of subversive writers whose jibes and violence of speech set up a ferment in his brain before they passed out of it into his crude writings

The essay was for him the chief labour of his week and every Tuesday, as he marched from home to the school, he read his fate in the incidents of the way, pitting himself against some figure ahead of him and quickening his pace to outstrip it before a certain goal was reached or planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork of the pathway and telling himself that he would be first and not first in the weekly essay

On a certain Tuesday the course of his triumphs was rudely broken. Mr Tate, the English master, pointed his finger at him and said bluntly:

—This fellow has heresy in his essay

A hush fell on the class. Mr Tate did not break it but dug with his hand between his thighs while his heavily starched linen creaked about his neck and wrists. Stephen did not look up. It was a raw spring morning and his eyes were still smarting and weak. He was conscious of failure and of detection, of the squalor of his own mind and home, and felt against his neck the raw edge of his turned and jagged collar

A short loud laugh from Mr Tate set the class more at ease

—Perhaps you didn't know that, he said

—Where? asked Stephen

Mr Tate withdrew his delving hand and spread out the essay

—Here. It's about the Creator and the soul. Rrm... rrm... rrm... Ah! WITHOUT A POSSIBILITY OF EVER APPROACHING NEARER. That's heresy

Stephen murmured:

—I meant WITHOUT A POSSIBILITY OF EVER REACHING

It was a submission and Mr Tate, appeased, folded up the essay and passed it across to him, saying:

—O...Ah! EVER REACHING. That's another story

But the class was not so soon appeased. Though nobody spoke to him of the affair after class he could feel about him a vague general malignant joy

A few nights after this public chiding he was walking with a letter along the Drumcondra Road when he heard a voice cry:

—Halt!

He turned and saw three boys of his own class coming towards him in the dusk. It was Heron who had called out and, as he marched forward between his two attendants, he cleft the air before him with a thin cane in time to their steps. Boland, his friend, marched beside him, a large grin on his face, while Nash came on a few steps behind, blowing from the pace and wagging his great red head

As soon as the boys had turned into Clonliffe Road together they began to speak about books and writers, saying what books they were reading and how many books there were in their fathers' bookcases at home. Stephen listened to them in some wonderment for Boland was the dunce and Nash the idler of the class. In fact, after some talk about their favourite writers, Nash declared for Captain Marryat who, he said, was the greatest writer

—Fudge! said Heron. Ask Dedalus. Who is the greatest writer, Dedalus?

Stephen noted the mockery in the question and said:

—Of prose do you mean?

—Yes

—Newman, I think

—Is it Cardinal Newman? asked Boland

—Yes, answered Stephen

The grin broadened on Nash's freckled face as he turned to Stephen and said:

—And do you like Cardinal Newman, Dedalus?

—O, many say that Newman has the best prose style, Heron said to the other two in explanation, of course he's not a poet

—And who is the best poet, Heron? asked Boland

—Lord Tennyson, of course, answered Heron

—O, yes, Lord Tennyson, said Nash. We have all his poetry at home in a book

At this Stephen forgot the silent vows he had been making and burst out:

—Tennyson a poet! Why, he's only a rhymester!

—O, get out! said Heron. Everyone knows that Tennyson is the greatest poet

—And who do you think is the greatest poet? asked Boland, nudging his neighbour

—Byron, of course, answered Stephen

Heron gave the lead and all three joined in a scornful laugh

—What are you laughing at? asked Stephen

—You, said Heron. Byron the greatest poet! He's only a poet for uneducated people

—He must be a fine poet! said Boland

—You may keep your mouth shut, said Stephen, turning on him boldly. All you know about poetry is what you wrote up on the slates in the yard and were going to be sent to the loft for

Boland, in fact, was said to have written on the slates in the yard a couplet about a classmate of his who often rode home from the college on a pony:

As Tyson was riding into Jerusalem He fell and hurt his Alec Kafoozelum

This thrust put the two lieutenants to silence but Heron went on:

—In any case Byron was a heretic and immoral too

—I don't care what he was, cried Stephen hotly

—You don't care whether he was a heretic or not? said Nash

—What do you know about it? shouted Stephen. You never read a line of anything in your life except a trans, or Boland either

—I know that Byron was a bad man, said Boland

—Here, catch hold of this heretic, Heron called out. In a moment Stephen was a prisoner

—Tate made you buck up the other day, Heron went on, about the heresy in your essay

—I'll tell him tomorrow, said Boland

—Will you? said Stephen. You'd be afraid to open your lips

—Afraid?

—Ay. Afraid of your life

—Behave yourself! cried Heron, cutting at Stephen's legs with his cane

It was the signal for their onset. Nash pinioned his arms behind while Boland seized a long cabbage stump which was lying in the gutter. Struggling and kicking under the cuts of the cane and the blows of the knotty stump Stephen was borne back against a barbed wire fence

—Admit that Byron was no good

—No

—Admit

—No

—Admit

—No. No

At last after a fury of plunges he wrenched himself free. His tormentors set off towards Jones's Road, laughing and jeering at him, while he, half blinded with tears, stumbled on, clenching his fists madly and sobbing

While he was still repeating the CONFITEOR amid the indulgent laughter of his hearers and while the scenes of that malignant episode were still passing sharply and swiftly before his mind he wondered why he bore no malice now to those who had tormented him. He had not forgotten a whit of their cowardice and cruelty but the memory of it called forth no anger from him. All the descriptions of fierce love and hatred which he had met in books had seemed to him therefore unreal. Even that night as he stumbled homewards along Jones's Road he had felt that some power was divesting him of that sudden-woven anger as easily as a fruit is divested of its soft ripe peel

He remained standing with his two companions at the end of the shed listening idly to their talk or to the bursts of applause in the theatre. She was sitting there among the others perhaps waiting for him to appear. He tried to recall her appearance but could not. He could remember only that she had worn a shawl about her head like a cowl and that her dark eyes had invited and unnerved him. He wondered had he been in her thoughts as she had been in his. Then in the dark and unseen by the other two he rested the tips of the fingers of one hand upon the palm of the other hand, scarcely touching it lightly. But the pressure of her fingers had been lighter and steadier: and suddenly the memory of their touch traversed his brain and body like an invisible wave

A boy came towards them, running along under the shed. He was excited and breathless

—O, Dedalus, he cried, Doyle is in a great bake about you. You're to go in at once and get dressed for the play. Hurry up, you better

—He's coming now, said Heron to the messenger with a haughty drawl, when he wants to

The boy turned to Heron and repeated:

—But Doyle is in an awful bake

—Will you tell Doyle with my best compliments that I damned his eyes? answered Heron

—Well, I must go now, said Stephen, who cared little for such points of honour

—I wouldn't, said Heron, damn me if I would. That's no way to send for one of the senior boys. In a bake, indeed! I think it's quite enough that you're taking a part in his bally old play

This spirit of quarrelsome comradeship which he had observed lately in his rival had not seduced Stephen from his habits of quiet obedience. He mistrusted the turbulence and doubted the sincerity of such comradeship which seemed to him a sorry anticipation of manhood. The question of honour here raised was, like all such questions, trivial to him. While his mind had been pursuing its intangible phantoms and turning in irresolution from such pursuit he had heard about him the constant voices of his father and of his masters, urging him to be a gentleman above all things and urging him to be a good catholic above all things. These voices had now come to be hollow-sounding in his ears. When the gymnasium had been opened he had heard another voice urging him to be strong and manly and healthy and when the movement towards national revival had begun to be felt in the college yet another voice had bidden him be true to his country and help to raise up her language and tradition. In the profane world, as he foresaw, a worldly voice would bid him raise up his father's fallen state by his labours and, meanwhile, the voice of his school comrades urged him to be a decent fellow, to shield others from blame or to beg them off and to do his best to get free days for the school. And it was the din of all these hollow-sounding voices that made him halt irresolutely in the pursuit of phantoms. He gave them ear only for a time but he was happy only when he was far from them, beyond their call, alone or in the company of phantasmal comrades

In the vestry a plump fresh-faced jesuit and an elderly man, in shabby blue clothes, were dabbling in a case of paints and chalks. The boys who had been painted walked about or stood still awkwardly, touching their faces in a gingerly fashion with their furtive fingertips. In the middle of the vestry a young jesuit, who was then on a visit to the college, stood rocking himself rhythmically from the tips of his toes to his heels and back again, his hands thrust well forward into his side-pockets. His small head set off with glossy red curls and his newly shaven face agreed well with the spotless decency of his soutane and with his spotless shoes

As he watched this swaying form and tried to read for himself the legend of the priest's mocking smile there came into Stephen's memory a saying which he had heard from his father before he had been sent to Clongowes, that you could always tell a jesuit by the style of his clothes. At the same moment he thought he saw a likeness between his father's mind and that of this smiling well-dressed priest: and he was aware of some desecration of the priest's office or of the vestry itself whose silence was now routed by loud talk and joking and its air pungent with the smells of the gas-jets and the grease

While his forehead was being wrinkled and his jaws painted black and blue by the elderly man, he listened distractedly to the voice of the plump young jesuit which bade him speak up and make his points clearly. He could hear the band playing THE LILY OF KILLARNEY and knew that in a few moments the curtain would go up. He felt no stage fright but the thought of the part he had to play humiliated him. A remembrance of some of his lines made a sudden flush rise to his painted cheeks. He saw her serious alluring eyes watching him from among the audience and their image at once swept away his scruples, leaving his will compact. Another nature seemed to have been lent him: the infection of the excitement and youth about him entered into and transformed his moody mistrustfulness. For one rare moment he seemed to be clothed in the real apparel of boyhood: and, as he stood in the wings among the other players, he shared the common mirth amid which the drop scene was hauled upwards by two able-bodied priests with violent jerks and all awry

A few moments after he found himself on the stage amid the garish gas and the dim scenery, acting before the innumerable faces of the void. It surprised him to see that the play which he had known at rehearsals for a disjointed lifeless thing had suddenly assumed a life of its own. It seemed now to play itself, he and his fellow actors aiding it with their parts. When the curtain fell on the last scene he heard the void filled with applause and, through a rift in a side scene, saw the simple body before which he had acted magically deformed, the void of faces breaking at all points and falling asunder into busy groups

He left the stage quickly and rid himself of his mummery and passed out through the chapel into the college garden. Now that the play was over his nerves cried for some further adventure. He hurried onwards as if to overtake it. The doors of the theatre were all open and the audience had emptied out. On the lines which he had fancied the moorings of an ark a few lanterns swung in the night breeze, flickering cheerlessly. He mounted the steps from the garden in haste, eager that some prey should not elude him, and forced his way through the crowd in the hall and past the two jesuits who stood watching the exodus and bowing and shaking hands with the visitors. He pushed onward nervously, feigning a still greater haste and faintly conscious of the smiles and stares and nudges which his powdered head left in its wake

When he came out on the steps he saw his family waiting for him at the first lamp. In a glance he noted that every figure of the group was familiar and ran down the steps angrily

—I have to leave a message down in George's Street, he said to his father quickly. I'll be home after you

Without waiting for his father's questions he ran across the road and began to walk at breakneck speed down the hill. He hardly knew where he was walking. Pride and hope and desire like crushed herbs in his heart sent up vapours of maddening incense before the eyes of his mind. He strode down the hill amid the tumult of sudden-risen vapours of wounded pride and fallen hope and baffled desire. They streamed upwards before his anguished eyes in dense and maddening fumes and passed away above him till at last the air was clear and cold again

A film still veiled his eyes but they burned no longer. A power, akin to that which had often made anger or resentment fall from him, brought his steps to rest. He stood still and gazed up at the sombre porch of the morgue and from that to the dark cobbled laneway at its side. He saw the word LOTTS on the wall of the lane and breathed slowly the rank heavy air

That is horse piss and rotted straw, he thought. It is a good odour to breathe. It will calm my heart. My heart is quite calm now. I will go back

Stephen was once again seated beside his father in the corner of a railway carriage at Kingsbridge. He was travelling with his father by the night mail to Cork. As the train steamed out of the station he recalled his childish wonder of years before and every event of his first day at Clongowes. But he felt no wonder now. He saw the darkening lands slipping away past him, the silent telegraph-poles passing his window swiftly every four seconds, the little glimmering stations, manned by a few silent sentries, flung by the mail behind her and twinkling for a moment in the darkness like fiery grains flung backwards by a runner

He listened without sympathy to his father's evocation of Cork and of scenes of his youth, a tale broken by sighs or draughts from his pocket flask whenever the image of some dead friend appeared in it or whenever the evoker remembered suddenly the purpose of his actual visit. Stephen heard but could feel no pity. The images of the dead were all strangers to him save that of uncle Charles, an image which had lately been fading out of memory. He knew, however, that his father's property was going to be sold by auction, and in the manner of his own dispossession he felt the world give the lie rudely to his phantasy

At Maryborough he fell asleep. When he awoke the train had passed out of Mallow and his father was stretched asleep on the other seat. The cold light of the dawn lay over the country, over the unpeopled fields and the closed cottages. The terror of sleep fascinated his mind as he watched the silent country or heard from time to time his father's deep breath or sudden sleepy movement. The neighbourhood of unseen sleepers filled him with strange dread, as though they could harm him, and he prayed that the day might come quickly. His prayer, addressed neither to God nor saint, began with a shiver, as the chilly morning breeze crept through the chink of the carriage door to his feet, and ended in a trail of foolish words which he made to fit the insistent rhythm of the train; and silently, at intervals of four seconds, the telegraph-poles held the galloping notes of the music between punctual bars. This furious music allayed his dread and, leaning against the windowledge, he let his eyelids close again

They drove in a jingle across Cork while it was still early morning and Stephen finished his sleep in a bedroom of the Victoria Hotel. The bright warm sunlight was streaming through the window and he could hear the din of traffic. His father was standing before the dressing-table, examining his hair and face and moustache with great care, craning his neck across the water-jug and drawing it back sideways to see the better. While he did so he sang softly to himself with quaint accent and phrasing:

'Tis youth and folly
Makes young men marry
So here, my love, I'll
No longer stay
What can't be cured, sure
Must be injured, sure
So I'll go to
Amerikay

My love she's handsome
My love she's bony:
She's like good whisky
When it is new;
But when 'tis old
And growing cold
It fades and dies like
The mountain dew

The consciousness of the warm sunny city outside his window and the tender tremors with which his father's voice festooned the strange sad happy air, drove off all the mists of the night's ill humour from Stephen's brain. He got up quickly to dress and, when the song had ended, said:

—That's much prettier than any of your other COME-ALL-YOUS

—Do you think so? asked Mr Dedalus

—I like it, said Stephen

—It's a pretty old air, said Mr Dedalus, twirling the points of his moustache. Ah, but you should have heard Mick Lacy sing it! Poor Mick Lacy! He had little turns for it, grace notes that he used to put in that I haven't got. That was the boy who could sing a COME-ALL-YOU, if you like

Mr Dedalus had ordered drisheens for breakfast and during the meal he cross-examined the waiter for local news. For the most part they spoke at cross purposes when a name was mentioned, the waiter having in mind the present holder and Mr Dedalus his father or perhaps his grandfather

—Well, I hope they haven't moved the Queen's College anyhow, said Mr Dedalus, for I want to show it to this youngster of mine

Along the Mardyke the trees were in bloom. They entered the grounds of the college and were led by the garrulous porter across the quadrangle. But their progress across the gravel was brought to a halt after every dozen or so paces by some reply of the porter's

—Ah, do you tell me so? And is poor Pottlebelly dead?

—Yes, sir. Dead, sir

During these halts Stephen stood awkwardly behind the two men, weary of the subject and waiting restlessly for the slow march to begin again. By the time they had crossed the quadrangle his restlessness had risen to fever. He wondered how his father, whom he knew for a shrewd suspicious man, could be duped by the servile manners of the porter; and the lively southern speech which had entertained him all the morning now irritated his ears

They passed into the anatomy theatre where Mr Dedalus, the porter aiding him, searched the desks for his initials. Stephen remained in the background, depressed more than ever by the darkness and silence of the theatre and by the air it wore of jaded and formal study. On the desk he read the word FOETUS cut several times in the dark stained wood. The sudden legend startled his blood: he seemed to feel the absent students of the college about him and to shrink from their company. A vision of their life, which his father's words had been powerless to evoke, sprang up before him out of the word cut in the desk. A broad-shouldered student with a moustache was cutting in the letters with a jack-knife, seriously. Other students stood or sat near him laughing at his handiwork. One jogged his elbow. The big student turned on him, frowning. He was dressed in loose grey clothes and had tan boots

Stephen's name was called. He hurried down the steps of the theatre so as to be as far away from the vision as he could be and, peering closely at his father's initials, hid his flushed face

But the word and the vision capered before his eyes as he walked back across the quadrangle and towards the college gate. It shocked him to find in the outer world a trace of what he had deemed till then a brutish and individual malady of his own mind. His monstrous reveries came thronging into his memory. They too had sprung up before him, suddenly and furiously, out of mere words. He had soon given in to them and allowed them to sweep across and abase his intellect, wondering always where they came from, from what den of monstrous images, and always weak and humble towards others, restless and sickened of himself when they had swept over him

—Ay, bedad! And there's the Groceries sure enough! cried Mr Dedalus. You often heard me speak of the Groceries, didn't you, Stephen. Many's the time we went down there when our names had been marked, a crowd of us, Harry Peard and little Jack Mountain and Bob Dyas and Maurice Moriarty, the Frenchman, and Tom O'Grady and Mick Lacy that I told you of this morning and Joey Corbet and poor little good-hearted Johnny Keevers of the Tantiles

The leaves of the trees along the Mardyke were astir and whispering in the sunlight. A team of cricketers passed, agile young men in flannels and blazers, one of them carrying the long green wicket-bag. In a quiet bystreet a German band of five players in faded uniforms and with battered brass instruments was playing to an audience of street arabs and leisurely messenger boys. A maid in a white cap and apron was watering a box of plants on a sill which shone like a slab of limestone in the warm glare. From another window open to the air came the sound of a piano, scale after scale rising into the treble

Stephen walked on at his father's side, listening to stories he had heard before, hearing again the names of the scattered and dead revellers who had been the companions of his father's youth. And a faint sickness sighed in his heart

He recalled his own equivocal position in Belvedere, a free boy, a leader afraid of his own authority, proud and sensitive and suspicious, battling against the squalor of his life and against the riot of his mind. The letters cut in the stained wood of the desk stared upon him, mocking his bodily weakness and futile enthusiasms and making him loathe himself for his own mad and filthy orgies. The spittle in his throat grew bitter and foul to swallow and the faint sickness climbed to his brain so that for a moment he closed his eyes and walked on in darkness

He could still hear his father's voice—

—When you kick out for yourself, Stephen—as I daresay you will one of these days—remember, whatever you do, to mix with gentlemen. When I was a young fellow I tell you I enjoyed myself. I mixed with fine decent fellows. Everyone of us could do something. One fellow had a good voice, another fellow was a good actor, another could sing a good comic song, another was a good oarsman or a good racket player, another could tell a good story and so on. We kept the ball rolling anyhow and enjoyed ourselves and saw a bit of life and we were none the worse of it either. But we were all gentlemen, Stephen—at least I hope we were—and bloody good honest Irishmen too. That's the kind of fellows I want you to associate with, fellows of the right kidney. I'm talking to you as a friend, Stephen. I don't believe a son should be afraid of his father. No, I treat you as your grandfather treated me when I was a young chap. We were more like brothers than father and son. I'll never forget the first day he caught me smoking. I was standing at the end of the South Terrace one day with some maneens like myself and sure we thought we were grand fellows because we had pipes stuck in the corners of our mouths. Suddenly the governor passed. He didn't say a word, or stop even. But the next day, Sunday, we were out for a walk together and when we were coming home he took out his cigar case and said:—By the by, Simon, I didn't know you smoked, or something like that.—Of course I tried to carry it off as best I could.—If you want a good smoke, he said, try one of these cigars. An American captain made me a present of them last night in Queenstown

Stephen heard his father's voice break into a laugh which was almost a sob

—He was the handsomest man in Cork at that time, by God he was! The women used to stand to look after him in the street

He heard the sob passing loudly down his father's throat and opened his eyes with a nervous impulse. The sunlight breaking suddenly on his sight turned the sky and clouds into a fantastic world of sombre masses with lakelike spaces of dark rosy light. His very brain was sick and powerless. He could scarcely interpret the letters of the signboards of the shops. By his monstrous way of life he seemed to have put himself beyond the limits of reality. Nothing moved him or spoke to him from the real world unless he heard in it an echo of the infuriated cries within him. He could respond to no earthly or human appeal, dumb and insensible to the call of summer and gladness and companionship, wearied and dejected by his father's voice. He could scarcely recognize as his own thoughts, and repeated slowly to himself:

—I am Stephen Dedalus. I am walking beside my father whose name is Simon Dedalus. We are in Cork, in Ireland. Cork is a city. Our room is in the Victoria Hotel. Victoria and Stephen and Simon. Simon and Stephen and Victoria. Names

The memory of his childhood suddenly grew dim. He tried to call forth some of its vivid moments but could not. He recalled only names. Dante, Parnell, Clane, Clongowes. A little boy had been taught geography by an old woman who kept two brushes in her wardrobe. Then he had been sent away from home to a college, he had made his first communion and eaten slim jim out of his cricket cap and watched the firelight leaping and dancing on the wall of a little bedroom in the infirmary and dreamed of being dead, of mass being said for him by the rector in a black and gold cope, of being buried then in the little graveyard of the community off the main avenue of limes. But he had not died then. Parnell had died. There had been no mass for the dead in the chapel and no procession. He had not died but he had faded out like a film in the sun. He had been lost or had wandered out of existence for he no longer existed. How strange to think of him passing out of existence in such a way, not by death but by fading out in the sun or by being lost and forgotten somewhere in the universe! It was strange to see his small body appear again for a moment: a little boy in a grey belted suit. His hands were in his side-pockets and his trousers were tucked in at the knees by elastic bands

On the evening of the day on which the property was sold Stephen followed his father meekly about the city from bar to bar. To the sellers in the market, to the barmen and barmaids, to the beggars who importuned him for a lob Mr Dedalus told the same tale—that he was an old Corkonian, that he had been trying for thirty years to get rid of his Cork accent up in Dublin and that Peter Pickackafax beside him was his eldest son but that he was only a Dublin jackeen

They had set out early in the morning from Newcombe's coffee-house, where Mr Dedalus's cup had rattled noisily against its saucer, and Stephen had tried to cover that shameful sign of his father's drinking bout of the night before by moving his chair and coughing. One humiliation had succeeded another—the false smiles of the market sellers, the curvetings and oglings of the barmaids with whom his father flirted, the compliments and encouraging words of his father's friends. They had told him that he had a great look of his grandfather and Mr Dedalus had agreed that he was an ugly likeness. They had unearthed traces of a Cork accent in his speech and made him admit that the Lee was a much finer river than the Liffey. One of them, in order to put his Latin to the proof, had made him translate short passages from Dilectus and asked him whether it was correct to say: TEMPORA MUTANTUR NOS ET MUTAMUR IN ILLIS or TEMPORA MUTANTUR ET NOS MUTAMUR IN ILLIS. Another, a brisk old man, whom Mr Dedalus called Johnny Cashman, had covered him with confusion by asking him to say which were prettier, the Dublin girls or the Cork girls

—He's not that way built, said Mr Dedalus. Leave him alone. He's a level-headed thinking boy who doesn't bother his head about that kind of nonsense

—Then he's not his father's son, said the little old man

—I don't know, I'm sure, said Mr Dedalus, smiling complacently

—Your father, said the little old man to Stephen, was the boldest flirt in the City of Cork in his day. Do you know that?

Stephen looked down and studied the tiled floor of the bar into which they had drifted

—Now don't be putting ideas into his head, said Mr Dedalus. Leave him to his Maker

—Yerra, sure I wouldn't put any ideas into his head. I'm old enough to be his grandfather. And I am a grandfather, said the little old man to Stephen. Do you know that?

—Are you? asked Stephen

—Bedad I am, said the little old man. I have two bouncing grandchildren out at Sunday's Well. Now, then! What age do you think I am? And I remember seeing your grandfather in his red coat riding out to hounds. That was before you were born

—Ay, or thought of, said Mr Dedalus

—Bedad I did, repeated the little old man. And, more than that, I can remember even your great-grandfather, old John Stephen Dedalus, and a fierce old fire-eater he was. Now, then! There's a memory for you!

—That's three generations—four generations, said another of the company. Why, Johnny Cashman, you must be nearing the century

—Well, I'll tell you the truth, said the little old man. I'm just twenty-seven years of age

—We're as old as we feel, Johnny, said Mr Dedalus. And just finish what you have there and we'll have another. Here, Tim or Tom or whatever your name is, give us the same again here. By God, I don't feel more than eighteen myself. There's that son of mine there not half my age and I'm a better man than he is any day of the week

—Draw it mild now, Dedalus. I think it's time for you to take a back seat, said the gentleman who had spoken before

—No, by God! asserted Mr Dedalus. I'll sing a tenor song against him or I'll vault a five-barred gate against him or I'll run with him after the hounds across the country as I did thirty years ago along with the Kerry Boy and the best man for it

—But he'll beat you here, said the little old man, tapping his forehead and raising his glass to drain it

—Well, I hope he'll be as good a man as his father. That's all I can say, said Mr Dedalus

—If he is, he'll do, said the little old man

—And thanks be to God, Johnny, said Mr Dedalus, that we lived so long and did so little harm

—But did so much good, Simon, said the little old man gravely. Thanks be to God we lived so long and did so much good

Stephen watched the three glasses being raised from the counter as his father and his two cronies drank to the memory of their past. An abyss of fortune or of temperament sundered him from them. His mind seemed older than theirs: it shone coldly on their strifes and happiness and regrets like a moon upon a younger earth. No life or youth stirred in him as it had stirred in them. He had known neither the pleasure of companionship with others nor the vigour of rude male health nor filial piety. Nothing stirred within his soul but a cold and cruel and loveless lust. His childhood was dead or lost and with it his soul capable of simple joys and he was drifting amid life like the barren shell of the moon

Art thou pale for weariness
Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth
Wandering companionless...?

He repeated to himself the lines of Shelley's fragment. Its alternation of sad human ineffectiveness with vast inhuman cycles of activity chilled him and he forgot his own human and ineffectual grieving

Stephen's mother and his brother and one of his cousins waited at the corner of quiet Foster Place while he and his father went up the steps and along the colonnade where the Highland sentry was parading. When they had passed into the great hall and stood at the counter Stephen drew forth his orders on the governor of the bank of Ireland for thirty and three pounds; and these sums, the moneys of his exhibition and essay prize, were paid over to him rapidly by the teller in notes and in coin respectively. He bestowed them in his pockets with feigned composure and suffered the friendly teller, to whom his father chatted, to take his hand across the broad counter and wish him a brilliant career in after life. He was impatient of their voices and could not keep his feet at rest. But the teller still deferred the serving of others to say he was living in changed times and that there was nothing like giving a boy the best education that money could buy. Mr Dedalus lingered in the hall gazing about him and up at the roof and telling Stephen, who urged him to come out, that they were standing in the house of commons of the old Irish parliament

—God help us! he said piously, to think of the men of those times, Stephen, Hely Hutchinson and Flood and Henry Grattan and Charles Kendal Bushe, and the noblemen we have now, leaders of the Irish people at home and abroad. Why, by God, they wouldn't be seen dead in a ten-acre field with them. No, Stephen, old chap, I'm sorry to say that they are only as I roved out one fine May morning in the merry month of sweet July

A keen October wind was blowing round the bank. The three figures standing at the edge of the muddy path had pinched cheeks and watery eyes. Stephen looked at his thinly clad mother and remembered that a few days before he had seen a mantle priced at twenty guineas in the windows of Barnardo's

—Well that's done, said Mr Dedalus

—We had better go to dinner, said Stephen. Where?

—Dinner? said Mr Dedalus. Well, I suppose we had better, what?

—Some place that's not too dear, said Mrs Dedalus

—Underdone's?

—Yes. Some quiet place

—Come along, said Stephen quickly. It doesn't matter about the dearness

He walked on before them with short nervous steps, smiling. They tried to keep up with him, smiling also at his eagerness

—Take it easy like a good young fellow, said his father. We're not out for the half mile, are we?

For a swift season of merrymaking the money of his prizes ran through Stephen's fingers. Great parcels of groceries and delicacies and dried fruits arrived from the city. Every day he drew up a bill of fare for the family and every night led a party of three or four to the theatre to see INGOMAR or THE LADY OF LYONS. In his coat pockets he carried squares of Vienna chocolate for his guests while his trousers' pocket bulged with masses of silver and copper coins. He bought presents for everyone, overhauled his room, wrote out resolutions, marshalled his books up and down their shelves, pored upon all kinds of price lists, drew up a form of commonwealth for the household by which every member of it held some office, opened a loan bank for his family and pressed loans on willing borrowers so that he might have the pleasure of making out receipts and reckoning the interests on the sums lent. When he could do no more he drove up and down the city in trams. Then the season of pleasure came to an end. The pot of pink enamel paint gave out and the wainscot of his bedroom remained with its unfinished and ill-plastered coat

His household returned to its usual way of life. His mother had no further occasion to upbraid him for squandering his money. He too returned to his old life at school and all his novel enterprises fell to pieces. The commonwealth fell, the loan bank closed its coffers and its books on a sensible loss, the rules of life which he had drawn about himself fell into desuetude

How foolish his aim had been! He had tried to build a break-water of order and elegance against the sordid tide of life without him and to dam up, by rules of conduct and active interest and new filial relations, the powerful recurrence of the tides within him. Useless. From without as from within the waters had flowed over his barriers: their tides began once more to jostle fiercely above the crumbled mole

He saw clearly too his own futile isolation. He had not gone one step nearer the lives he had sought to approach nor bridged the restless shame and rancour that had divided him from mother and brother and sister. He felt that he was hardly of the one blood with them but stood to them rather in the mystical kinship of fosterage, fosterchild and fosterbrother

He turned to appease the fierce longings of his heart before which everything else was idle and alien. He cared little that he was in mortal sin, that his life had grown to be a tissue of subterfuge and falsehood. Beside the savage desire within him to realize the enormities which he brooded on nothing was sacred. He bore cynically with the shameful details of his secret riots in which he exulted to defile with patience whatever image had attracted his eyes. By day and by night he moved among distorted images of the outer world. A figure that had seemed to him by day demure and innocent came towards him by night through the winding darkness of sleep, her face transfigured by a lecherous cunning, her eyes bright with brutish joy. Only the morning pained him with its dim memory of dark orgiastic riot, its keen and humiliating sense of transgression

He returned to his wanderings. The veiled autumnal evenings led him from street to street as they had led him years before along the quiet avenues of Blackrock. But no vision of trim front gardens or of kindly lights in the windows poured a tender influence upon him now. Only at times, in the pauses of his desire, when the luxury that was wasting him gave room to a softer languor, the image of Mercedes traversed the background of his memory. He saw again the small white house and the garden of rose-bushes on the road that led to the mountains and he remembered the sadly proud gesture of refusal which he was to make there, standing with her in the moonlit garden after years of estrangement and adventure. At those moments the soft speeches of Claude Melnotte rose to his lips and eased his unrest. A tender premonition touched him of the tryst he had then looked forward to and, in spite of the horrible reality which lay between his hope of then and now, of the holy encounter he had then imagined at which weakness and timidity and inexperience were to fall from him

Such moments passed and the wasting fires of lust sprang up again. The verses passed from his lips and the inarticulate cries and the unspoken brutal words rushed forth from his brain to force a passage. His blood was in revolt. He wandered up and down the dark slimy streets peering into the gloom of lanes and doorways, listening eagerly for any sound. He moaned to himself like some baffled prowling beast. He wanted to sin with another of his kind, to force another being to sin with him and to exult with her in sin. He felt some dark presence moving irresistibly upon him from the darkness, a presence subtle and murmurous as a flood filling him wholly with itself. Its murmur besieged his ears like the murmur of some multitude in sleep; its subtle streams penetrated his being. His hands clenched convulsively and his teeth set together as he suffered the agony of its penetration. He stretched out his arms in the street to hold fast the frail swooning form that eluded him and incited him: and the cry that he had strangled for so long in his throat issued from his lips. It broke from him like a wail of despair from a hell of sufferers and died in a wail of furious entreaty, a cry for an iniquitous abandonment, a cry which was but the echo of an obscene scrawl which he had read on the oozing wall of a urinal

He had wandered into a maze of narrow and dirty streets. From the foul laneways he heard bursts of hoarse riot and wrangling and the drawling of drunken singers. He walked onward, dismayed, wondering whether he had strayed into the quarter of the Jews. Women and girls dressed in long vivid gowns traversed the street from house to house. They were leisurely and perfumed. A trembling seized him and his eyes grew dim. The yellow gas-flames arose before his troubled vision against the vapoury sky, burning as if before an altar. Before the doors and in the lighted halls groups were gathered arrayed as for some rite. He was in another world: he had awakened from a slumber of centuries

He stood still in the middle of the roadway, his heart clamouring against his bosom in a tumult. A young woman dressed in a long pink gown laid her hand on his arm to detain him and gazed into his face. She said gaily:

—Good night, Willie dear!

Her room was warm and lightsome. A huge doll sat with her legs apart in the copious easy-chair beside the bed. He tried to bid his tongue speak that he might seem at ease, watching her as she undid her gown, noting the proud conscious movements of her perfumed head

As he stood silent in the middle of the room she came over to him and embraced him gaily and gravely. Her round arms held him firmly to her and he, seeing her face lifted to him in serious calm and feeling the warm calm rise and fall of her breast, all but burst into hysterical weeping. Tears of joy and relief shone in his delighted eyes and his lips parted though they would not speak

She passed her tinkling hand through his hair, calling him a little rascal

—Give me a kiss, she said

His lips would not bend to kiss her. He wanted to be held firmly in her arms, to be caressed slowly, slowly, slowly. In her arms he felt that he had suddenly become strong and fearless and sure of himself. But his lips would not bend to kiss her

With a sudden movement she bowed his head and joined her lips to his and he read the meaning of her movements in her frank uplifted eyes. It was too much for him. He closed his eyes, surrendering himself to her, body and mind, conscious of nothing in the world but the dark pressure of her softly parting lips. They pressed upon his brain as upon his lips as though they were the vehicle of a vague speech; and between them he felt an unknown and timid pressure, darker than the swoon of sin, softer than sound or odour",82309,en,en,en,60aPGlcoCQi9TXLKhklrXO

To love without fear and learn without question
How could I regret the meant occasions

Paddle upon the clouds one's own canoe

How could I

Humility take charge of me
Drown me in truth's modest waters
Loosen your grip identity
Free me from an ego's falter

Love too often is only a dream
If I am harsh and unkind to myself
So I share these attitudes with you
Must I try? How could I?

A Comfortable Silence,rap,Proper Aristoi,2013,88,{},"[Verse 1]

You know it's been a long time since I was truly interested
With anything that this world had to offer in the present
The scars were recessive, I was carved with a message
And if life leaves wreckage, the past was a lesson
I will be respected as an artist with a method
Who could leave these filthy peasants with pure hate and bitter resentment
I could put you in a box and make you live within a sentence
That's beyond your comprehension
Polishing my weapons is my deficit of attention
A lack of affection but the arrow on my compass broke so ups my new direction
Show no neglect as I weave threats of intellect
Regrets don't intersect so don't speak for your protection
See it's not about your recollection
It's about the future
The world doesn't care what you shoulda, coulda, used to
Everyday's a new challenge, you must overcome
So I'm always spitting knowledge, shedding light by speaking over drums
Maybe one day we'll be conscious without using drugs
Maybe meditate on mountain tops with Tibetan Monks
Yet today it seems to be that medicating's all we love
Turning up the music to forget about the wrongs you've done
Forget about the wrongs you've done, forgive yourself begin anew
Try to know that all that matters is, the truth
Every person has a past, present and a future
But in the end what's left is one
You
[Hook]

It's a comfortable silence that I'm sitting in
No words spoken but I'm still intently listening
Every sound, every breath, every single heart beat

[Verse 2]

Listen little Markus, with the skill you contain
You could grow to be great, but I bounce from the place
And make sound from the noise, pressure on the cap as I play with my poison
My voices is poised in positions so awkward
Paint, or a pen and a mind like clockwork
Writing up a long verse
Seeds in the soft dirt, and yes it's fertile
I've been working in my shell, I'm a Ghost, not a turtle
Leaping over hurdles that some deemed impossible
Think like the genius and steer clear of obstacles
This path's not walkable, kick back and watch it though
And learn to use percussive voice, in the age of information
Ignorance is just a choice, wake up, speak out against the noise
Every time your heart beats is another point proven
For the people in the movement we're all tryna make a difference
But in truth we're only human
And it's comin' out of nowhere, people say it's no fair
But I tend to disagree, so I step forth to tear the seams
Between what's reality and what exists as just a dream
It's all the same, don't you see?
What you sense and percieve?
Time is of the essence, and the essence is a tree
It's called Life and it provides all you need
Climbing to the peak, I close my eyes and cease to speak
On the tip of every mountaintop in existential clarity

The coronation of a slavering monarch
And all that wilts beneath his hand
A spectre hangs gallow-strung over your every movement
A revenant of jutting ribs
Witnesses the glory of the end
Tonight, rejoice
The coronation of a walking prison
And all that crumbles to ash within
Diseased and shining like the northern lights
Buried in 100 years of radio static
Like the northern lights in the funeral pyre of the world
Fused at the tongue to the admission of failure
So I toil alone, wracked with suffocating silence
In this blinding haze
Waiting for the starbursts to dissipate and life to begin again
Blood is thick with spit and ash
Cigarette burns on parchment skin
Voice is thin, ulcer-lashed
With old wounds and holes to rub hurt in
Staggering slowly rendered inhuman
Sinking somewhere revealed in

Tangerine,rock,Sky Swamp Orange,2018,102,{Descendant},"Tangerine
Verse 1:
Hazelnut eyes in a dim lit room
Isn’t something I’m accustomed to
Few laps around the sun with a different one
But here I am orbiting you
You’re like an evening sunset with a silhouette of trees
You’re like the first sigh of relief during a seaside breeze
And when the morning birds sing and do what they do
Well I assume that they’re thinking of you (oo)
Caterpillars in cocoons
They’re hatching in my stomach and I don’t know what to do
Because now we’re heating up and It feels like a lagoon
Girl I’m trying to relieve steam underneath your blue moon
You got me spinning in circles and falling to the ground
Daydreaming and singing like nobody’s around
So tell me girl how does it sound
Baby can I lay you down
Chorus:
And when I’m feeling low her loving gets me high
She always keeps me moving when I’m barely getting by
You’re all I want and all I need
Maybe we can be
So why not come a little close and let me pick your mind
Tangle me up, all up in your vines
You’re all I want and all I need
Sweet tangerine
Verse 2:
And I was sipping real slowly
On my St. Ides 40
Baby caught me off guard
Chilling out with the homies
Got me doing double takes now and I feeling a little wobbly
She got everything need like baileys in my coffee
Can I take you for a ride or is it too soon
Because I’m addicted to your bad attitude you’re so rude
She cool like my liquor but she hot as the summer
And we’ll be shining like the stars that always hover above her my lover
Verse 3: Descendant
She’s my sweet citrus sap in the bong (barn?)
She don’t even know the lyrics but she’s rapping along
Not a centerfold model thats advertising for bottles
She's just a hippy in the city that's pulling me full throttle
Got the hots but i just flop when opportunity’s knocking
Introversion gets the worst of me when I see those pupils poppin
Stop and stare before turns around and notices the creep in me
But something's telling me don't let her get away easily, ‘cause I
Can’t get her off my mental
So hard to act gentile
When all i wanna do is skip the talk and walk along your waterfall
Keeping you from sleeping on the number that you gotta call
Time is ticking on the more we wait, yeah
And I won't let my seconds suffocate
And I won't let you run off with another guy
I’d be a fool if i let her pass by ‘cause...
Bridge:
She’s my sweet tangerine
Underneath the turquoise sky
I could waste away the day
Just thinking about her eyes
Oh and lately I felt crazy
With this nonsense on my mind
Yeah she hid from me all winter
But she bloomed in summer time
Chorus: 2x
And when I’m feeling low her loving gets me high
She always keeps me moving when I’m barely getting by
You’re all I want and all I need
Maybe we can be
So why not come a little close and let me pick your mind

Let it shine down
Look at the lights we undergound now
If you don't recognize you'll get lost in the tunnel
Stuck in this hole with no life in this funnel
Rock the mic you out of bounds now
Nothing but net at the end of the show
I'll see nothing but gold at the end of the road
Some nights it feels souls are sold
Walk through Gods gates through these psalms
Hell is more cold then we thought
I see my vision distraught
I see some holes in whats taught
Play heavy metal the ax has been sharpened till that metals dropped
Who is your rock?
We only do it for rocks
All of the chains thats been rocked
All of the nations been rocked
Dummer like sum filled in box
Who do we box?
Is it flesh, spirit, blood, man who do you see?
Its just me
Deshawn, God  all my peeps
Pantyhose through all of my streets
Forest trees inside my concretes
Kept me cloud 9 with an itchy finger
Instead of holding Gods peace
OMG (echo)
It's like a sad sad song
Feels like Ferguson when the blam blam going
Just another Mike Brown in a Trevon hoodie
With a Malcolm X pistol tell the devil was goodie
Another victim shot down
How could he?
Buzz kill since the day that they heard that the Christ got woody

Wanna new Mercedes and a R&R
Wanna get signed from A&R

If Gods is ours
Just wait the hour
And it won't stop now
Preach truth even though we getting shot down

Let’s see if your love is committed to me

[Verse]
Why I gotta buy you a ring?
When love ain't consist of material things
Even without my love, you more, if not the same
They say with love you gon' cry tears, but why happiness bring pain?
I ain't gon lie, love been knocked me out my shoes
What make my heart be beating fast then beating slow? I be confused
I ain't gon' lie, this shit here new
My Cupid point me straight to you
I needed love, he sent me you
Get butterflies when I'm 'round you
Is that something love do?
Without your heart, I can't breathe
About your soul, I go underneath
I never thought it was this deep
Thoughts of you leaving made me weak
Without your presence, I can't sleep
Me and you against the world
Is that how love's 'posed to be?
[Chorus]
Loyalty, is there someone who gon' be loyal to me?
Trust, do that mean I can rely on you?
Tell you a secret and won't lead me on?
My last question is commitment
I wanna see if you dedicated, help me get situated
No mixed emotions in between, honor me just like a king
Let’s see if your love is committed to me",4748544,en,en,en,6w6UiZ5x8iK1sKHdxsTKNp

Servants, grab your weapons
It's time for the show
Don’t care about what shall happen
The Alien needs to go

The final attack is prepared
It must be quick and fatal
Make sure he isn't aware
Avoid a huge battle

And, my loyal soldiers, do not bother
With collateral damage
Those who will stay in our way
Shall be punished

Cleaning our path
Leaving no regret
Killing for the new world

Planting a new lie
Deceiving every eye
Feeding the beasts inside
[Robert]:
My friend, you're not alone
I’ll struggle with you side by side
I'll cut his veins, spilling his blood
That president deserves to die

Death is running
Through my fearsome body
Killing is becoming
My favorite hobby

Cleaning all the mess
Leaving no regret
Killing for a free world

Fighting the evil trend
Protecting our new friend
Releasing the righteous man

Robert, you've got to leave this place

No, I'll cover you ‘till you arrive to space

May run away (may run away)
But in the end, you are the one who will pay

But you chose the wrong path

They should know the extent of my wrath

Your special and stranger friend
May run away but in the end
You are the one who will pay

It's a grim scenario of full destruction… And all of this against a guy who hasn't been hostile? Is this necessary?
That’s the question we’re starting to ask
Holy… We can observe the presence of a human being covering the Alien, while he's trying to fly into space… There are more people joining him to help…
People are turning against the military forces!
People are turning against the system""

Once guided by hope, now fallen into despair

His eyes without light, his walk weak and still
He lost all pride already years ago
Sleeplessness every night - Throught of regret
He knows there will be a tomorrow, but why wake up again
All he wanted was freedom, the hope to perhaps fulfill some dreams
A better life for his children, a little piece from the sky... But fate betrayed him again
Family and friendship, the only things he never had
Destroyed by comsuption, replaced by egoism and greed, just shame remains
From the very beginning he had no role in the game
Given up, driven to alcohol, to forget about everything

And yeah I'm kinda high but I hold it all together like a paper clip
I made another drink, Future playing again
Heard that Molly Percocet joint banging again
Sat around the table chilling for like 2 or 3 hours
'Til the bottles ran dry and the food was devoured
I checked my phone around 1 in the morning, the time was soaring
And noticed that I had gotten a text that said ""I'm horny""
From this chick I want to smash since last summer
Checked my pocket, I was down to my last rubber, that's perfect
Couple homies dipped, another sleep on the couch
Told Kyle I was dipping, grabbed my keys and I'm out
He asked if I was straight to drive, said ""You freaking me out""
""Chill dawg, yeah I'm fine man, you freaking me out""

[Key jingling, car starting]
[Verse 3]
Pussy on my mind, girl I'm thinking 'bout you
Let my car warm up for a minute or two
I been thinking 'bout the things that I'm itching to do
And ain't a single person stopping me from getting to you
I said ""I'm coming"" and she made a joke
It gave me hope that she'll do everything that she's saying yo
I'm 20 minutes out, I can't reverse the mission
And truthfully I am a little drunk but I've driven under worse conditions
35 miles the whole time
'Cause I don't need no cops stopping me at the goal line
And I don't need a ""Dewey"" dawg 'cause I don't got no money for that
Fuck, I barely even got enough money for gas
She texted ""How close baby?""
""Oh it's funny you ask
I'm 'bout 10 minutes out and I'ma bust in that ass""
This what happens when you stick to the plan dawg
Know these back roads like the back of my hand dawg
I blinked for just a second, shit that really came up quicker than expected
Saw some lights and didn't fucking realize the road was bending

[Verse 4]
I opened up my eyes, I'm alive, doctors looking surprised
With no major issues, it's a miracle you're alright
I thank God or my guardian angel
Who used his halo to save me from something fatal
I'm eternally grateful
Then he got a little lower, looked me right in my eyes
Said ""You hit some other people and they didn't survive
You killed a mother and her baby, the daughter was 5""
That was 'bout the moment I was wishing I died",5079089,en,en,en,2bnC5zBurRcTAebDakTXA3
Put Out the Fire,pop,The Hellacopters,2005,619,{},"Put out the fire and set me free
Put out the fire and help me let it be
Can't let it go on or it will take me to some end
I can't right all these wrongs or make amends

Maybe your mind works different than mine
Maybe your mind is of another kind
The things that you do, the things you hear and see
Maybe it's you and not me

Put out the fire, stamp out the glow
'Fore the stakes get any higher
You know I know that I should know
The fire's still raging and I've counted to ten

Hold my breath and I'm waiting
Want to exhale but don't know when
Can't seem to put it out
Keep trying, though I am in doubt

I've drained the oceans dry but I cannot put it out
Put out the fire, help me turn it around

To write the wrongs I left behind
To undo all the damage I have done

[Verse 1]
Now they say I'm too big for my breeches
Apparently it's not intelligent to burn bridges
Through history they've always burnt witches
Nowadays it seems that we just earn riches
Got an iPhone full of pictures of bitches
Don't tell my wife cause snitches get stitches
Smoking spliffs with Sid Vicious
Hand on my heart, none of this is fictitious
Told him, if you see left eye, send my best wishes
What can I say, I'm overly ambitious
In the kitchen but not washing the dishes
On the stove cooking up something nutritious
All my patrons say my food is delicious
That's why the future looks so auspicious
Fucked this chick last night and she was from Mauritius
Didn't wear a rubber though and now it itches
Could this be the cause of these nervous twitches
Don't know for sure but I'm getting suspicious
This sort of living I couldn't of have envisioned
Done so much Charlie that it's blurring my vision
About to get a suit fitted by a mortician
It's not bad, just means we've come to fruition

[Interlude]
You know when I was young
My uncle used to beat the shit out of me man
Belts, canes, whatever he could get his hands on, the cunt
I used to pray every night that something would happen to him, something horrible
So he would feel how he made me feel, you know
And one really rainy day on his way home from work
He crashed his motor into a tree
The crash didn't kill him but the car burst into flames and he burned alive
Witnesses said they heard him screaming for help for minutes until he eventually let go, right
They said you could smell the burning flesh for miles man
I never told anyone about this until last year
When I got smashed on Tequila and ended up telling my bird like
She got all emotional and starting crying
You know, she squeezed my hand like really hard
And said ""You see? You see God is great!""
I was baffed like
I said ""Why? I never prayed to God in my life...""

I'm in the sticks like Pat Jennings
And my girl's tits bigger than Kat Dennings'
I got a half ounce in my black denims
No say it's leng so you know how that's smelling
Tottenham, just like Lennon
One, drop me on the doorstep like John Lennon
Cause I'm fucking more bitches than Ellen
Travelling the world just like Magellan
Uh, I'm selling, my pockets are swelling
Man are well jel and that's why they're telling
If you want this half, to get you off your melon
Just give me the score like Jeff Stelling
Yeah it's CAS but it's not Cass Pennant
Na, walk through the ends so many cunts breading
Same cunts who be talking shit and spreading
These slags want deading
Their heads want lead in

With more envelopes than a Greek wedding
Yeah it's hot so I watch where I'm treading
I don't need the wellies though, I know where I'm heading
Tonsil tennis with Jess Ennis
I'm holding the mandy, like Les Dennis
When I get on it I'm a menace
It's drama, it's drama, it's the merchant of Venice
Slum lord, bumping my tenants
Big can of Tennent's
Drugs to sell to everyone in attendance
You paid a fortune, I paid a pittance
When you see the price tag you're bound to have kittens
I shot to the fat one in Atomic Kitten
Katona or whatever her name was
I sold her some weight, she lost some weight, she's no longer famous
Or in my radius
I'm in a green Honda Accord
Pushing three keys like I'm playing a chord
From a place where you get bored
And people stand round and applaud
People take what they can't afford
Forcing whores into doing card fraud

Can we fill this room with blood?

Always one foot on the floor

Can you find yourself?

To run and hide. To run and hide

To run and hide. To run and hide. (I hear you, I see)

Two hands on, got her doin' up gwok gwok
I ain't gotta talk what I done
Man done got active with the dot-dot
I don't really fuss about music
I move it straight right out of this hot spot
8 bills on my feet, I look taller
She in love with my aura
Tryna pop this half of corn up
But Trill's tryna call me for a quick order
In the ends, ain't nuttin' but order
Turn your marjae straight to a mourner
Water, water, wet, splash
Suttin' got bored up
I just spent three weeks in the t-house
Now I'm uptown, doin' nuttin' but drip
See I'm pissed if I burn this drip
If I see me a opp, it ain't nuttin' but fish
This music has to go click
I'm tryna take care of my mummy and mix
I'm outside, I'm takin' a risk
Hands on the trap, takin' a piss
I just bashed out buj point 9 on the curb
On my life, man's makin' a flip
Boujee one from Hammersmith
On me, said she wan' make me a kid
Are you takin' the piss?
Man's hittin' it once, and I'm makin' a skid
I just backed my dick on Incog's grave
And now I'm out takin' a piss
Jumped out my bed, put my feet in Gucci
Back strap this doobie
Got a little fetish for backs
Mad, brownskin one with the booty
Still tryna ying them paigons
Do that shit like it's my duty
Brownskin one, she a cutie
But I told bro ""don't love these groupies""

Man flip more keys than a iPad
Or I'm defendin' my block like a right back

Man flow on the beat like the oceans
Splash man down, have 'em swimmin' or floatin'
I just saw me an opp, done a mad ting
Hopped out the whip while the whip's in motion
But you know that the gang-gang loadin'
Matter of time til' us man loaded
I ain't really fuss about the driver
The passenger sit when he's doin' up poachin'

Wishing I knew

I should've run from you
I should've run, but I couldn't move
You know I hadn't to prove
I should've run from you
Sunday morning, your hand in mine
Though my window, the light dim shine
Somehow, it felt so right
In a land, far from here
Another man is missing you dear
With your eyes, a sleepless night
I should've run from you
I should've run, but I couldn't move
You know I hadn't to prove
I should've run from you
All of the broken hearts behind you smile
Ain't no different than mine
All of the memories reminds me every while
I should've run from you
That I should've run
Hmmm, I should've run from you
I should've run, but I couldn't move
I hadn't no clue

The suffering and the hate way too long
Life is going on too long, surprised i’m not dead
Dead, because I
Seemed to suck my insides dry
And how my pain tribes inside
And when my body doesn’t float
Cut me up from a motor boat
The toilet overflowed, and drowned my sorrow
So nothing is left for me
Can’t be content and be me

The pain goes on and won’t leave me alone
Sharpening my nails on the edge of a stone
The dark forms a cloud around my brain
And none of you know how badly I feel the pain
The things I have tried to swallow
The happiness refuses to follow
Suffocating in my own saliva
Having the larva inside lay all of it’s eggs
No here is where I lay
I hate today

Shuffled in a deck of Jokers, I'm the Ace of Spades
My skull contains a brain that's sharper than a razor blade
I spit it super, man (Superman), I'm here to save the day
I paved my way and sprayed the flames so I can make my name
Yo, I'm off the chain just like an emancipated slave
Always dropping hits, leaving holes in the floorboard
Watch me put my Vans on and simply walk into Mordor
It's indubitable, the fact that I blow minds
I'm you, but bigger and faster, iPhone 5
My oh my, that's what the fans are yelling
When my vocal chords and tongue get orders from my cerebellum
To create my raps fancy, but that's chancy
Lyrical steam roller, turn haters to Flat Stanley
Hit'cha with the dope flow, then you'll get ocho
Even Hellen Keller saw that I'm muy talentoso
An Avatar, but I'm missing Appa and Momo
Reppin' Viera from Florida down to Johto
I'm Ho-Oh flying high above you dodos
I slay (sleigh) tracks like Santa on railroads, bro
It's the creative caucasian crushing it constantly
Dismembering any instrumental's my policy
So follow me, every rhyme I write increases in quality
Always spitting it dope, I'm studied in pharmacology
A dramamine junkie, rapping 'till my lungs bleed
All across the web like the toes in a duck's feet
Touch me? Impossible, your girl wants me in it
So I rolled over like AT&T minutes
3 digits that I'll carry on my back in war
Raw and foul, putting dogs down, Marcus Lattimore
My paper's stone, I etch my verses with a magic sword
And leave all my haters melted like dishwashing a plastic fork
I'm rapping more than Santa's elves could even hope to bare
Word to Roger, I'm white as albino polar bears
I'll place my team at the top and I plan to hold it there
Until in every area my sound waves roam the air
Hot as a solar flare, my flow is rare, so watch me
Make it cause I'm more hungry for the top than a starving zombie
Smart as Ghandi, Rhyming for a few cheers
I'll never drop the ball, not even on New Year's
I'm vanquishing various villains with the vocab
Same as rubbing flint when pencil meets notepad
Oh snap, call me Raven Simon
In my all visions I can see I'll be taking the throne",100649,en,en,en,

Yeah It should be easy to see
That I’ll never love you girl
Like you love me

I’m not the kind ~
I’m not made for sticking around ~

Gold for a life's treasury

Searched in the moon, found the answers
Sold to the next mystery

Swept streets
Clean sun sheets

Row down the river with me

Ships that pass never last

FUCK, you! (haha) I'm all nuts, no glory
You're walkin now but nigga what's the story?
You better, duck when I go BOOM, cause suckers bore me
And yeah, I probably hate Tommy Boy as much as Nore do
Who the best?  Eminem, Jigga or Nas?
Cause when it comes lottery time, that spot'll be mines
You takin the throne is under the bridge
And yeah, you might be +Ready to Die+ but none of you +Big+
So, you've been dared to listen
'til the fiercest rhythm'll spit air condition glitter and wrist cool
FUCK doom, I don't age
Cut ""Boom"" up loud and see a mushroom cloud on stage {*explosion*}
Do the math, four knuckles'll give you six months
And, you niggas is so pussy you make my dick jump (haha)
I don't wish to be king, I'll pass the throne
Whatever shines too bright shines half as long
I don't kiss hoes, I only put my lips on a cup
Pee-wee niggas, go somewhere and piss on your nuts (haha)
God gave me this life, and if he decides to envy and give me
I'm takin the flow of the century with me
Oh, so if you feel insane, and want a war
Reality check, you not ready, your soldiers is still in trainin
A bunch of hundreds that'll read the menu
We run tabs with receipts sayin ""To be continued..""
And - bully niggas this is your day
Meet me at the flagpole so you can hit me in my fists with your face
And snitch niggas is common as E-Bay wear
Uhh, give the cops more +Alerts+ than DJ Red
I got the blood of a dead soldier, on my palms
And the scent of yo' bitch lingerin on my fingertips
And you niggas is deep, I got a deep barrel that'll blaze
So FUCK deep, the deep shall lay in a shallow grave

Chew up your vest and turn your chest hair to taco meat!

With the buckshots shells'll turn a nigga into Chinese Checkers

That's what you get, when Beatminers meet the Wordsmiths
Uhh, every time I go out, I cop somethin new
Every time I throw this right hand I knock somethin loose
Who the fuck think they can see me?  Might as well
Call the wife and tell her you're not comin home and to take it easy
My guns don't shoot, they WOOF!
At them sissy-ass niggas type to accidentally shoot they foot
Desert Eagle too big for you bitch-ass niggas
Soft-ass palms, can't take the kickback niggas
And you wonder why they suckin my dick
Or why I keep a suitcase with a hundred grand handcuffed to my wrist
Or why the watch could possibly make you lose your sight blinkin
On the wrist, lookin like halogen hazard lights blinkin

Snake boots blister in pursuit of the inside-out
Pray for rain in the shadow of a drought
Sleep for solace in-between bouts
Some drunken boats in dark mouths searching for light house truth
There is no use

What will it take to make you?
What will they say about you?
This wheel will turn without you
Leaping vows and absolutes
Swearing out from armored suits
Announce all life's forbidden fruits till the bitter end
Slowly losing faith in friends
Investing it in providence
With a fist and teeth in wired clench of the newfound proof
There is no use

What will they say about you?

Espousing sober facts
Despising those who jump the tracks
Saying they can never have their innocence back
Seeking out forgiving ashore when doctrines don't make sense anymore
A stranger opens up his door to let you in

Replace your hate

You need to know your problems aren't from someone else
Deep down inside you hate yourself
The lies you learned that say you have no self-worth
Are bringing you down to your hurt
There's no escaping the suffering of this pain
With replacing the hate that remains

I got two wings on my back like an angel
But got two horns on my head like Lucifer
Or when it come down to this beef shit
Nigga think he get stupid, but I get stupider
I just fucked a bitch one time
And she already talkin' 'bout marriage and want me to move with her
And if you can pull my bitch, you can have that bitch
But you probably don't know what to do with her
It's that time of the month for some of these niggas
These pussy-ass niggas finna start catchin' cramps
It was too dark in that nigga apartment
So we finna light his shit up like a lamp
Ain't no Wrestlemania, but go'n 'head, give me that belt
'Cause nigga, I feel like a champ
And I ain't never been to the Forbes
But I smoke 'Woods like I always knew how to count
I be tryna hide my gun, but the clip poke out
Like some toes stickin' out of a sandal
Ayy, twenty-four shots, it ain't got no attachment
But it got the F&N stamp on the handle
I'm straight out the jungle, so you know the fur on my jacket
Came straight off the back of a mammal
Ayy, I know a bitch that can suck that dick so good
No teeth, she don't use no enamel

Haha
I know a bitch that can suck that dick so good
No teeth, she don't use no enamel, oh

[Verse 2]
Like I untied my shoes, I keep takin' trips
Them racks in the middle like Roddy and Nip
You can kiss my dick, you can kiss my balls
But look, lil' bitch, don't kiss my lips
I know they smellin' me, they too nosy
It's Friday, I'm tryna get high like Smokey
I'm feelin' like MJ holdin' the trophy
I been in my bag like a whole lot of groceries
That struggle and hustle shit, that's what made me
Never in my life will this rap shit change me
Beat by Milan, but it hit like Tay Keith
I'm goin' hard in LA like AD
Get the gas from LA, get the stick from the cholo
I'm showin' my ass like I'm droppin' my Polos
If a nigga bitch up, then I'm doin' it solo
These hoes always leave and come back like a yoyo
Instagram got broke niggas lookin' like Diddy
Instagram got ugly hoes thinkin' they pretty
Go clean out the toilet, 'cause I left it shitty
This beat kinda hard like some fake-ass titties
Got a bitch real short, but she got a deep throat
Had to earn my bucks, nigga, no free throw
Bitch said I'm a jackass, no Steve-O
And we own our cars, nigga, no repo
At grandma house prayin' to Guadalupe
And I'm in your neighborhood, nigga, no 2K
Counted my first hundred, then I said hooray

I roll a ’73 Chevy Caprice
Straight stocked out hubcaps and elites
A four-door mob shot, that’s what I got
Burn a little rubber on a punk ass sahob
A fat ass fleet that’s pumpin’ the beat
A Zapco board to make things complete
I ride and side, whip and dip
Spotted in the seat with a joint on my lip
Ready to take the cops on a high-speed chase
Put up your pink slip ‘cause I’m ready to race
Man, I’m so tight, I just blow right
Past a muthafucka and yes his hoe might
Flag me down the next time she see me
But flaggin’ down Dre ain’t that easy
Steady lookin’ out for the black-and-white ones
So I can hit the gas, swing some tight ones
In my mob shot Chevrolet, I roll every day
And bullshit tapes I’ll never play
I bump $hort and Spice, and MC Pooh
That gangsta shit, I thought you knew
Man, I’m so cool, in my old school
Steady pullin’ bitches when I hit the high school
Short and tall, light and heavy
They all wanna ride in my Chevy

Strikin’ with the SES when I’m tacked from the chronic
Ride slow just like the comp on the elites
And I’mma fuck ya dome when I see you in the streets
But in the driver seat, stride way too low, fool
When I strike, I watch what your hoe do
Trick I know you hate the SES crew
We straight Chev’ strikin’ on these punk ass niggas too
Fool, what you know about the Strictly SES soldier?
Fuckin’ with the doja, it might have me in a coma
Nathan nice from the north of the Valley Jo

Known to live illegal but Feds never find a trace

Never rappin’ fake and we zappin’ across every state
Comin’ up is my fate, so punks love to playa hate
But see I never trip because the Chev' is lookin’ hella whipped
Every nigga and they bitch is sprung on this playa shit
So when you see me, man, punch it
Because the squad is in the town with the Zapco adjusted
Fifteens bumpin’ as I hit the highways on the turf with Smurf
Hittin’ the block sideways
And I can swing it five ways, danked, always in a daze

Momma my friend’s a Thug and a hard head, a Superman who thinks’ he’s flyer than
Clark Kent but he ain’t ever been/
Drug’s hit hard like nevirapine, born to win but this cat thinks it’s the norm to sin/
His loose screws are amusing with two spoons in the tongue, droops booze and abusing
With new tools in the lung/
A gift to every woman he said, he’d give a gift to every woman that’s dead now/
Are you living walking or are you walking for the living, a life of books or are you giving
Books life/
A whip nice, built with big lights, Big House what would it be with no good wife/
A Jerabo type it’s looking like its new money, a dunce in class homie defines the new
Dummy/
His has a wild style refer to him as alarm, girl if you’re next remember to keep the armor

Verse 2
Momma my friend loves to Pick and Pay, she Shops-rite and loves to play these silly
Games – Who is this girl?
She must be a former black individual from the powder pack a large slap would just
Cause mad residuals/
See cash is pivotal, in her life it’s mystical – twitter, facebook, instagram that’s the
Visual!
She’s not even herself anymore a fraction of her real self and selfies define her wealth/
Designer clothes, fast cars but an empty fridge; a bulimic mind state and she loves the
Binge/

Take A Bow,rap,Prime Sinister,2020,14,{},"Stellar rays
A fella sprays in the cellar grade, lemonade haze, it’s a day for the seller pay
The smell of spray is the fragrance that serenades basements of vagrants and sadists and renegades
They headed straight to the gate as they bettered fate, placing a payment to masons for severed slates
They detonate all the places that levitate, feigning and staining the day that the terror breaks

Festering
Testing of the Wesson he’s indentured in, wrestling the lessons, it’s a testament to mescaline
Pestering, resting in fluorescence with a jester’s grin, entering the session as the vessel he’s successful in
Gentle king, central in his mental was the menthol sting, gesturing and peddling confessions with a pencil swing
Censoring, embezzling the devil with a nectarine, mentoring potential, he’s resentful as the rental spins

Round to the crown with a pound of the loud
Ground it and mount it, it’s hounding the drowned
He listened, heating up the old soup
His gold tooth was positioned from the eating of the cold food
He’s to be christened in the rose hues
Of dole queues, he’s conditioned to the meeting with his old blues
It’s his suspicion, and he holds clues
That his beating of his demons was a mission for his soled shoes
For he envisioned that his soul moves
In position, it has stiffened but his mission was to hold fuse
He’d treat remission as a gold boom
As mould grew on condition it was treated as a bold move
A deep division as his prose oozed
A cold bruise from the gritting and admitting it’s an old wound
A weeping vision of a joke loomed
His own room, a collision of ambition and an old feud
His disposition was his cold stew
In its deficiency, existence was imprisonment for old fools

Doubt besets
He’ll reap reason from a drought cassette, he’d sleep, leaving his achievements in a mount of debt
He’d sleep, breathing in an ounce of ket, he’ll keep treason as a feeling, he was leaving as a malcontent
He’d keep wheezing as he’d mount regret, he’ll meet creatures and their demons that were heaving from a shouted bet
He’ll heat, steaming up the alphabet, He’s weak, dreaming in the heathens that were seething but without regret

The Wreck Of The Birkenhead,misc,Frances Anne Kemble,2013,32,{},"A BRITISH TRANSPORT VESSEL LOST ON THE COAST OF AFRICA.
A BALLAD.


As well as I am able, I'll relate how it befell,
And I trust, sirs, you'll excuse me, if I do not speak it well.
I've lived a hard and wandering life, serving our gracious Queen,
And have nigh forgot my schooling since a soldier I have been.

But however in my untaught speech the tale I tell may thrive,
I shall see the scene before me, to the latest day I live;
And sometimes I have scarce the heart to thank God for saving me,
When I think of my poor comrades, who went down in that dreadful sea,
And my brother's drowning eyes and voice, as a monstrous swirling wave
Rolled him right across my arms, 'twas his winding sheet and grave—

God forgive me! but I wish he had been saved instead of me,
He was a better, braver man than ever I shall be.

The night was still and silent, and the stars shone overhead,
And all were sleeping in the ship, who in one hour were dead.
A heavy swell was rolling in upon the treacherous shore,
And the steersman steered off from the coast, four miles, and barely four.
Six hundred sleeping souls relied upon that helmsman's care,
Poor wretch! the sea has saved him from a terrible despair!
For in that still and starlight night, on that smooth and silent sea,
He sent four hundred sleeping men straight to eternity;
He drove the ship upon the rocks that stretch the waves beneath,
It has been called Point Danger—it should be the Reef of Death.
I was dreaming of old Scotland, the home of my boyish years,
And the sound of the village bagpipe was droning in my ears;
And across the purple heath, behind a screen of fir and oak,
I saw from our low chimney curl the silver blue peat smoke;

My foot was on the door-stone, and my hand was on the lock,
And I heard my mother's voice within—when, suddenly, a shock
Went shuddering through the whole ship's frame, and then a grinding sound,
And the cry was heard above, below, 'Back her! she is aground!'
We heard the water rushing, whence or where we did not know,
And every face was darkened with terror and with woe;
But our officers did all that brave gentlemen could do,
And the sailors did their duty,—they were a gallant crew!
And we poor soldiers, too, sirs, I dare think, did all we could,
We had thought to die upon dry land, not choke in the weltering flood,
But steady, as if we had been on our old parading ground,
We stood till she went to pieces,—and the most of us were drowned.
With the first shock the word was given to put the engine back,
For we saw, when the sea was sucked away, where the reef lay, bare and black,
Right underneath the poor ship's prow, huge, hard, and without motion,
Beneath the sweltering, seething surf, of the restless, rolling ocean;

And it was terrible to hear the engine heave and throb,
Like the huge heart of a giant, with a sound like a heavy sob;
And it cast its shining arms aloft, and the wheels began to turn,
And the mad waves flashed, and whirled, and hissed, as they felt the strong ship spurn.
Another stroke, and we were off—but the black reef's stony teeth,
Had bitten through her iron ribs, and the sea rushed in beneath,
And up and up the water rose, fast, faster yet and higher,
And leapt into our ship's warm heart, and danced above the fire,
The shining arms fell motionless, and stopped the mighty breath,
And the mad waves sucked us back again, into the jaws of death.
Like horses plunging on the reef, we could see them through the dark,
The flying of their wild white manes made a long and shining mark,
And beyond where the rolling blackness, ridge upon ridge was tost,
Not four miles off, how near, and yet how distant! was the coast.
And now there came another shock, with a hideous crashing sound,
The ship broke right in half—and whirling madly round and round,

Half was sucked down before our eyes, and the water far and near,
Was strewed with hapless, helpless men, whose cries of pain and fear
Drove us wild with terror and with grief, as we stood upon the wreck,
The shivering, shattered, slippery planks, of that miserable deck.

Our wives and children in the boats had been lowered from the side,
And through the dark we heard them, as their wild farewells they cried;
And many a brave man's heart grew sick, as silently he stood,
And heard those bitter wailings rise and sink with the heaving flood:
But not one foot was stirred, and not one hand was raised to fly,
We were bid to stand there on that deck—and we stood still there to die.

At length word of command was given: 'Save yourselves all who can,'
And then, and not till then, away broke every boy and man,
When a loud voice, like an angel's, rose above the infernal din,
'Don't swamp your wives and children, hold back, if you are men!'

We looked into each other's eyes—the boats put off to shore—
And suddenly above my head I felt the billows pour.
I threw my arms abroad to swim—and found that they were cast
(Lord what a gripe I closed them with!) around our gallant mast:
As up the blessed shaft I clomb, shouting in frenzied glee,
The mad waves' thundering voices seemed to call alone for me;
But along the high main-topsail yard I climbed, and crawled, and clung,
And out into the empty night, over the sea I swung;
And others followed in the dark, that fearful, slippery way,
And there we held, and hung, and prayed, for the dear light of day;
And pray you, sirs, that never you may count such hideous hours,
Or know the agony and dread of those speechless prayers of ours.

All in a heap our limbs were twined, holding by one another,
And one man clutched my right arm fast, alas! 'twas not my brother;
I wound my hands around the spar, tight, tight, with the grip of Death,
And in my mortal fear I seized the wood fast in my teeth;

And as each high wave struck the mast, and shook us to and fro,
We could see the sharks' white bellies turn in the sea below.

Just as the day was breaking, I grew dizzy, faint, and sick,
And I heard the man who held me breathing heavily and quick,
His limbs slid slowly down, while with one hand he still did clasp
My arm, and I felt it yielding in the dead man's fatal grasp,
I flung it loose, still holding by one arm alone, while he,
With a heavy plunge fell fathoms down, into the churning sea—
He was dead, sirs, he was dead, yet my eyes grew glazed and dim
With horror, for I felt as if I just had murdered him,
And with that thought my wits gave way, for 'twas followed by another,
At which I shrieked aloud—that I had cast away my brother.

And this is all that I can tell—for I saw and heard no more
Till life came into me again, as I lay upon the shore;
I and a few poor fellows that a boat had fetched away,
By God's grace, from that direful mast, with the blessed light of day.
Our eyes were full of tears, as we looked towards the fatal reef,
Where above the surf the swinging yard seemed to beckon for relief,

For our comrades who lay rolling all round the sunken mast,—
They were brave fellows, sirs, and did their duty to the last:
And I hope that I may say it without unbecoming pride,
There are gallant soldiers, well I know, in many a land beside,
But I think that none but Englishmen like those men would have died.",227118,en,en,en,

bending, choked, over their thick jackets.

A Franklin stove keeps the place so cozy
it’s hard to imagine why anyone would leave,

clumping across the frozen beach to the river.
December’s always the same at Ware’s Cove,

the first sheer ice, black, then white
and deep until the city sends trucks of men

with wooden barriers to put up the boys’
hockey rink. An hour of skating after school,

of trying wobbly figure-8’s, an hour
of distances moved backwards without falling,

then—twilight, the warming house steamy
with girls pulling on boots, their chafed legs
aching. Outside, the hockey players keep
playing, slamming the round black puck

until it’s dark, until supper. At night,
a shy girl comes to the cove with her father.

Although there isn’t music, they glide
arm in arm onto the blurred surface together,

braced like dancers. She thinks she’ll never
be so happy, for who else will find her graceful,

find her perfect, skate with her
in circles outside the emptied rink forever?",542006,en,en,en,

Life Enemy,pop,Valtari,2021,8,{},"Kaleidoscope of scenes assault your inner core
A tainted husk of vileness left standing at your fall
To live a thousand years engulfed within the flames
Or to die on lonely battlefields, one of countless slain

Where is the line between protector and the beast?
An indistinct transparent form that time shall not release
An embodiment of darkness, yet burning light to some
Consuming all displayed before it borne on wings of blood

So let your hunger take you by the hand
It will lead you to the place of madness, no longer free
As nations crumble, cut away within
Left standing on blackened ruins – your life enemy

Where is your promise as I stand upon this ground?
Dreams dead before me, only nightmares to be found
Eroded lie within – a seething well of hate
Never to find victory, never to escape

So let your hunger take you by the hand
It will lead you to the place of madness, no longer free
As nations crumble, cut away within
Left standing on blackened ruins – your life enemy
So let your hunger take you by the hand
It will lead you to the place of madness, no longer free

The Mysterious Island - Part 1 - Chapter 16,misc,Jules Verne,1874,21,{},"It was the 6th of May, a day which corresponds to the 6th of November in the countries of the Northern Hemisphere. The sky had been obscured for some days, and it was of importance to make preparations for the winter. However, the temperature was not as yet much lower, and a centigrade thermometer, transported to Lincoln Island, would still have marked an average of ten to twelve degrees above zero. This was not surprising, since Lincoln Island, probably situated between the thirty-fifth and fortieth parallel, would be subject, in the Southern Hemisphere, to the same climate as Sicily or Greece in the Northern Hemisphere. But as Greece and Sicily have severe cold, producing snow and ice, so doubtless would Lincoln Island in the severest part of the winter and it was advisable to provide against it.

In any case if cold did not yet threaten them, the rainy season would begin, and on this lonely island, exposed to all the fury of the elements, in mid-ocean, bad weather would be frequent, and probably terrible. The question of a more comfortable dwelling than the Chimneys must therefore be seriously considered and promptly resolved on.

Pencroft, naturally, had some predilection for the retreat which he had discovered, but he well understood that another must be found. The Chimneys had been already visited by the sea, under circumstances which are known, and it would not do to be exposed again to a similar accident.

""Besides,"" added Cyrus Harding, who this day was talking of these things with his companions, ""we have some precautions to take.""

""Why? The island is not inhabited,"" said the reporter.

""That is probable,"" replied the engineer, ""although we have not yet explored the interior; but if no human beings are found, I fear that dangerous animals may abound. It is necessary to guard against a possible attack, so that we shall not be obliged to watch every night, or to keep up a fire. And then, my friends, we must foresee everything. We are here in a part of the Pacific often frequented by Malay pirates—""

""What!"" said Herbert, ""at such a distance from land?""

""Yes, my boy,"" replied the engineer. ""These pirates are bold sailors as well as formidable enemies, and we must take measures accordingly.""

""Well,"" replied Pencroft, ""we will fortify ourselves against savages with two legs as well as against savages with four. But, captain, will it not be best to explore every part of the island before undertaking anything else?""

""That would be best,"" added Gideon Spilett.

""Who knows if we might not find on the opposite side one of the caverns which we have searched for in vain here?""
""That is true,"" replied the engineer, ""but you forget, my friends, that it will be necessary to establish ourselves in the neighborhood of a watercourse, and that, from the summit of Mount Franklin, we could not see towards the west, either stream or river. Here, on the contrary, we are placed between the Mercy and Lake Grant, an advantage which must not be neglected. And, besides, this side, looking towards the east, is not exposed as the other is to the trade-winds, which in this hemisphere blow from the northwest.""

""Then, captain,"" replied the sailor, ""let us build a house on the edge of the lake. Neither bricks nor tools are wanting now. After having been brickmakers, potters, smelters, and smiths, we shall surely know how to be masons!""

""Yes, my friend; but before coming to any decision we must consider the matter thoroughly. A natural dwelling would spare us much work, and would be a surer retreat, for it would be as well defended against enemies from the interior as those from outside.""

""That is true, Cyrus,"" replied the reporter, ""but we have already examined all that mass of granite, and there is not a hole, not a cranny!""

""No, not one!"" added Pencroft. ""Ah, if we were able to dig out a dwelling in that cliff, at a good height, so as to be out of the reach of harm, that would be capital! I can see that on the front which looks seaward, five or six rooms—""

""With windows to light them!"" said Herbert, laughing.

""And a staircase to climb up to them!"" added Neb.

""You are laughing,"" cried the sailor, ""and why? What is there impossible in what I propose? Haven't we got pickaxes and spades? Won't Captain Harding be able to make powder to blow up the mine? Isn't it true, captain, that you will make powder the very day we want it?""

Cyrus Harding listened to the enthusiastic Pencroft developing his fanciful projects. To attack this mass of granite, even by a mine, was Herculean work, and it was really vexing that nature could not help them at their need. But the engineer did not reply to the sailor except by proposing to examine the cliff more attentively, from the mouth of the river to the angle which terminated it on the north.

They went out, therefore, and the exploration was made with extreme care, over an extent of nearly two miles. But in no place in the bare, straight cliff, could any cavity be found. The nests of the rock pigeons which fluttered at its summit were only, in reality, holes bored at the very top, and on the irregular edge of the granite.

It was a provoking circumstance, and as to attacking this cliff, either with pickaxe or with powder, so as to effect a sufficient excavation, it was not to be thought of. It so happened that, on all this part of the shore, Pencroft had discovered the only habitable shelter, that is to say, the Chimneys, which now had to be abandoned.

The exploration ended, the colonists found themselves at the north angle of the cliff, where it terminated in long slopes which died away on the shore. From this place, to its extreme limit in the west, it only formed a sort of declivity, a thick mass of stones, earth, and sand, bound together by plants, bushes, and grass inclined at an angle of only forty-five degrees. Clumps of trees grew on these slopes, which were also carpeted with thick grass. But the vegetation did not extend far, and a long, sandy plain, which began at the foot of these slopes, reached to the beach.

Cyrus Harding thought, not without reason, that the overplus of the lake must overflow on this side. The excess of water furnished by the Red Creek must also escape by some channel or other. Now the engineer had not yet found this channel on any part of the shore already explored, that is to say, from the mouth of the stream on the west of Prospect Heights.
The engineer now proposed to his companions to climb the slope, and to return to the Chimneys by the heights, while exploring the northern and eastern shores of the lake. The proposal was accepted, and in a few minutes Herbert and Neb were on the upper plateau. Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft followed with more sedate steps.

The beautiful sheet of water glittered through the trees under the rays of the sun. In this direction the country was charming. The eye feasted on the groups of trees. Some old trunks, bent with age, showed black against the verdant grass which covered the ground. Crowds of brilliant cockatoos screamed among the branches, moving prisms, hopping from one bough to another.

The settlers instead of going directly to the north bank of the lake, made a circuit round the edge of the plateau, so as to join the mouth of the creek on its left bank. It was a detour of more than a mile and a half. Walking was easy, for the trees widely spread, left a considerable space between them. The fertile zone evidently stopped at this point, and vegetation would be less vigorous in the part between the course of the Creek and the Mercy.

Cyrus Harding and his companions walked over this new ground with great care. Bows, arrows, and sticks with sharp iron points were their only weapons. However, no wild beast showed itself, and it was probable that these animals frequented rather the thick forests in the south; but the settlers had the disagreeable surprise of seeing Top stop before a snake of great size, measuring from fourteen to fifteen feet in length. Neb killed it by a blow from his stick. Cyrus Harding examined the reptile, and declared it not venomous, for it belonged to that species of diamond serpents which the natives of New South Wales rear. But it was possible that others existed whose bite was mortal such as the deaf vipers with forked tails, which rise up under the feet, or those winged snakes, furnished with two ears, which enable them to proceed with great rapidity. Top, the first moment of surprise over, began a reptile chase with such eagerness, that they feared for his safety. His master called him back directly.

The mouth of the Red Creek, at the place where it entered into the lake, was soon reached. The explorers recognized on the opposite shore the point which they had visited on their descent from Mount Franklin. Cyrus Harding ascertained that the flow of water into it from the creek was considerable. Nature must therefore have provided some place for the escape of the overplus. This doubtless formed a fall, which, if it could be discovered, would be of great use.

The colonists, walking apart, but not straying far from each other, began to skirt the edge of the lake, which was very steep. The water appeared to be full of fish, and Pencroft resolved to make some fishing-rods, so as to try and catch some.

The northeast point was first to be doubled. It might have been supposed that the discharge of water was at this place, for the extremity of the lake was almost on a level with the edge of the plateau. But no signs of this were discovered, and the colonists continued to explore the bank, which, after a slight bend, descended parallel to the shore.

On this side the banks were less woody, but clumps of trees, here and there, added to the picturesqueness of the country. Lake Grant was viewed from thence in all its extent, and no breath disturbed the surface of its waters. Top, in beating the bushes, put up flocks of birds of different kinds, which Gideon Spilett and Herbert saluted with arrows. One was hit by the lad, and fell into some marshy grass. Top rushed forward, and brought a beautiful swimming bird, of a slate color, short beak, very developed frontal plate, and wings edged with white. It was a ""coot,"" the size of a large partridge, belonging to the group of macrodactyls which form the transition between the order of wading birds and that of palmipeds. Sorry game, in truth, and its flavor is far from pleasant. But Top was not so particular in these things as his masters, and it was agreed that the coot should be for his supper.

The settlers were now following the eastern bank of the lake, and they would not be long in reaching the part which they already knew. The engineer was much surprised at not seeing any indication of the discharge of water. The reporter and the sailor talked with him, and he could not conceal his astonishment.

At this moment Top, who had been very quiet till then, gave signs of agitation. The intelligent animal went backwards and forwards on the shore, stopped suddenly, and looked at the water, one paw raised, as if he was pointing at some invisible game; then he barked furiously, and was suddenly silent.
Neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions had at first paid any attention to Top's behavior; but the dog's barking soon became so frequent that the engineer noticed it.

""What is there, Top?"" he asked.

The dog bounded towards his master, seeming to be very uneasy, and then rushed again towards the bank. Then, all at once, he plunged into the lake.

""Here, Top!"" cried Cyrus Harding, who did not like his dog to venture into the treacherous water.
""What's happening down there?"" asked Pencroft, examining the surface of the lake.

""Top smells some amphibious creature,"" replied Herbert.

""An alligator, perhaps,"" said the reporter.

""I do not think so,"" replied Harding. ""Alligators are only met with in regions less elevated in latitude.""

Meanwhile Top had returned at his master's call, and had regained the shore: but he could not stay quiet; he plunged in among the tall grass, and guided by instinct, he appeared to follow some invisible being which was slipping along under the surface of the water. However the water was calm; not a ripple disturbed its surface. Several times the settlers stopped on the bank, and observed it attentively. Nothing appeared. There was some mystery there.

The engineer was puzzled.

""Let us pursue this exploration to the end,"" said he.

Half an hour after they had all arrived at the southeast angle of the lake, on Prospect Heights. At this point the examination of the banks of the lake was considered finished, and yet the engineer had not been able to discover how and where the waters were discharged. ""There is no doubt this overflow exists,"" he repeated, ""and since it is not visible it must go through the granite cliff at the west!""

""But what importance do you attach to knowing that, my dear Cyrus?"" asked Gideon Spilett.

""Considerable importance,"" replied the engineer; ""for if it flows through the cliff there is probably some cavity, which it would be easy to render habitable after turning away the water.""

""But is it not possible, captain, that the water flows away at the bottom of the lake,"" said Herbert, ""and that it reaches the sea by some subterranean passage?""

""That might be,"" replied the engineer, ""and should it be so we shall be obliged to build our house ourselves, since nature has not done it for us.""

The colonists were about to begin to traverse the plateau to return to the Chimneys, when Top gave new signs of agitation. He barked with fury, and before his master could restrain him, he had plunged a second time into the lake.

All ran towards the bank. The dog was already more than twenty feet off, and Cyrus was calling him back, when an enormous head emerged from the water, which did not appear to be deep in that place.

Herbert recognized directly the species of amphibian to which the tapering head, with large eyes, and adorned with long silky mustaches, belonged.

""A lamantin!"" he cried.

It was not a lamantin, but one of that species of the order of cetaceans, which bear the name of the ""dugong,"" for its nostrils were open at the upper part of its snout. The enormous animal rushed on the dog, who tried to escape by returning towards the shore. His master could do nothing to save him, and before Gideon Spilett or Herbert thought of bending their bows, Top, seized by the dugong, had disappeared beneath the water.
Neb, his iron-tipped spear in his hand, wished to go to Top's help, and attack the dangerous animal in its own element.

""No, Neb,"" said the engineer, restraining his courageous servant.

Meanwhile, a struggle was going on beneath the water, an inexplicable struggle, for in his situation Top could not possibly resist; and judging by the bubbling of the surface it must be also a terrible struggle, and could not but terminate in the death of the dog! But suddenly, in the middle of a foaming circle, Top reappeared. Thrown in the air by some unknown power, he rose ten feet above the surface of the lake, fell again into the midst of the agitated waters, and then soon gained the shore, without any severe wounds, miraculously saved.

Cyrus Harding and his companions could not understand it. What was not less inexplicable was that the struggle still appeared to be going on. Doubtless, the dugong, attacked by some powerful animal, after having released the dog, was fighting on its own account. But it did not last long. The water became red with blood, and the body of the dugong, emerging from the sheet of scarlet which spread around, soon stranded on a little beach at the south angle of the lake. The colonists ran towards it. The dugong was dead. It was an enormous animal, fifteen or sixteen feet long, and must have weighed from three to four thousand pounds. At its neck was a wound, which appeared to have been produced by a sharp blade.
What could the amphibious creature have been, who, by this terrible blow had destroyed the formidable dugong? No one could tell, and much interested in this incident, Harding and his companions returned to the Chimneys.",2405845,en,en,en,

He touched me music type

I went to the church cause I was lonely, feeling lost, feeling down, feeling scared, I prayed on my knees at the alter, for god to guide me

When I looked up with my eyes wide open, boy was I surprised

3 angels were right there before me, so brightly alive

God came to me to guide me, and I was just a scared little child

It scared me, so I ran out of the church, I didn’t get far before I stopped in my tracks… I slowly walked back to the church, with my heart beating fast in my chest

The angels were gone but I knew then, god had answered my Prayers

From that moment on, I felt not lost or lonely, I knew god was right by my side, no longer a scared little child

No longer a scared little child

You always see it
When you're coming into town
Once you hang it on the wall
You can never take it down

And it's that feel
You can pawn your watch and chain
But not that feel

Always comes and finds you
It will always hear you cry

And I swear on my glass eye
It will never leave you high and dry
Never leave you loose
It's harder to get rid of than tattoos

One thing you can't lose

You can throw it off a bridge
You can lose it in a fire
You can leave it at the altar

Fall down in the street
You can leave it in the lurch

And now I'm standing on the edge and I'm prepared to fly
I will not dare deny, that I was dead inside
But with the music I could choose to then repair the mind
And now I'm feeling like I'm flying right up to the top
You though I left but now I'm back to come and take the lot
I'll continue to just bring you every take I drop
No way will I change, I'm gonna make it, I won't fade or stop

Everyone want to know why; why try the rap shit?
I won't lie; I think at the time was '05
Drink at the park, would like to stay high
But I spit till a rhyme was ready; go time!
I'm work two jobs, so didn't know I was out with the boys on drugs most nights
With a pure voice, freestyle so I
But it's all good, what I went though
Who knew through tears would invent you
So when others got jobs, I would stay home a lot
Smoke pot with a book and a pen too
Ha ha, look where it got me
Better yet, have a listen to where it got me
ABK Records; who, what's that?
You just need to rap and then not be chat
Build a fan base up and we got your back
Have their back back when you rap your tracks
Too many people want a hand-out, with their hands out
Like they're gonna stand out in a damn crowd
For the ones putting work in their sound, can make a damn man change and a man proud
To the others, don't prove yourself, go practise your moves, you can lose as well
I'm a simple mind, but I tell the truth
Every letter I spell myself is true
Fans hear this, they know it's me
Every thought I record when I flow the beats
I won't stop or quit, nah
I got this shit, brah
I've made it too far to cave or lose, nah
I'm making moves fast, to pave my future
Will never let go, I'ma state my truth, brah, forever

I'll continue to just bring you every take I drop
No way will I change, I'm gonna make it, I won't fade or stop

Now I sit here thinking; how long till this ship be sinking?
When I think of this shit; I live this
Get it on a pad, quickly, as I think it
Not good, nah, not for the time being
Here's a little bit of life from what I've seen
Like I've got fly scene
I see clear, like in my dreams of the future where I'll be
And I might be wrong but I don't know
But you never will know if you don't show
I'ma give it all I got when I flow dope shit in the moment; capture my photos
And when we were kids, we were fiending, needing a reason to live
Then the sight got spoke; gave us a mic at precisely the right time, leaving a gift
So I wrote, then I wrote, then I wrote some more
Get better each day so I wrote some more
At the time never thought about what's in store
Now I got an album, I'll drop it in stores
And I can not change my past but the way that I put 'em in bars
Creating a path that will lead me to success, make a mark
But to get there I gotta play my part
And I'm hoping that I won't quit, don't think that I can, I'm addicted to it
The bar's set high, now I'm lifting it
I won't sit or just quit, shit, I live for this
You have to low down, you have to know now
My raps have no bounds, attracted both crowds
Passion grows out to rep my hometown
Never gave up and the fans are so proud now
This my chance where I, can stand a chance in life
And now I'm standing on the edge and I'm prepared to fly
I will not dare deny, that I was dead inside

These so-called chips on our shoulder
Are the building-blocks of equality
I do not need permission to recall my history

Black Britain and America are not the same
But we see you
And we feel your pain

I Am Trayvon Martin
For our races and birthplaces
We are not to blame

I stare into this shattered mirror
A society that reflects our own
Black America, you are not alone

Our paths are not parallel
But our struggles need not be separate
If we teach our children to never forget
That before any wars on terror
There were wars on our humanity
Labelling us less than we were born to be

Equal

Though most days it feels we are guilty
Until proven innocent
Failures until we achieve something excellent

But it's also our right not to excel
To live normal decent lives
And not fear bullets and jail

Not have to justify our existence or presence
In countries built on our backs with no thanks or penance
It's not just the taxis and black cabs not stopping for us
It's the police and civilians targeting us

It's losing out to the white candidate
Despite the same qualifications
Or getting the job
And people calling it positive discrimination

Yes, I've got a big black chip on my shoulder
And this pink one too
LGBT and feminist, I will stand by you
America, I have only stood on your soil once
And I don't understand all of your laws
But yours is a struggle I cannot ignore

There are many more struggles that need to unite too

Prepare to exist by the living & dead

Continued through mirrors left broken to sing and be heard
Through when it seems all the senses are lost to absurd

They laugh because silence is never around
Ignored and forgotten, the past may continue to breathe
Feared not a rest by this desolate friend
Whose patience revealed what intent comes to send

Above all the dark nested clouds that keep guard of the sky

The Penhalonga Piper,pop,John Edmond,1979,196,{},"Oh once there was a farmer
He was an Eastern highlander
He a Scottish boarderer, so many years ago
Each night he'd give his bag a squeeze
His pipes would echo on the breeze
The music rolled with graceful ease
The Penhalonga Piper
The night that they attacked him
Were rockets on a homely hearth
The anger rose up in the heart
To the Penhalonga Piper
He reached for his long-rifle
And when he’d fired every round
He played the highland battle sound
The Penhalonga Piper
The Vendens (??) did not want to fight
The Squrlin (??) devils in the night
They fled in fear and in fright to
The Penhalonga Piper
They fled in one big yellow streak
And ran in dune to Mozambique
And he was angry for a week

Jealousy’s a Killer,rock,Ashes of My Regrets,2014,7,{},"[Intro]
Do you feel me reaching out my hand
From the bottom of the hell you left me
Don't you dare think
I won't rise again

[Verse 1]
They say jealousy's a killer and i can see it's killing you
You mean nothing in my life and you're a fucking waste of time
So here's what were gonna do
I'll go live my life and like i always said
I will never be broken down by anything
It's kind of funny how much hateful words are coming
From the person who's glass house is shattered by everything
So tell me
What haunts you in the night
Is that what gives you all this fight
Or the demons that you've locked away inside
They eat away at your mind
They twist what's wrong from right
And they take the sense you've clearly left behind
[Chorus]
Nothing you say ever means a thing
And one day you'll regret all you said to me
(And i will watch you suffering)
One day you'll see that you're wrong
And you will wonder where the time has gone
(Where did it go?)
You wasted it all on me

OHH

We're all the fucking same
And with this blinding aggression and our golden intentions
Try to knock us down we'll only come back stronger
Now make my fucking day
Please if you have a problem be my guest and take it up with me
And if you ever find yourself going insane
Hearing voices in the back of your head
We are the noise we are the reason why
Have fun trying to sleep tonight
Nothing you say ever meant a thing
Nothing you say ever meant a fucking thing

[Chorus]
Nothing you say ever means a thing
And one day you'll regret all you said to me
(And i will watch you suffering)
One day you'll see that you're wrong
And you will wonder where the time has gone
(Where did it go?)
You wasted it all on me

So tell me
What haunts you in the night
Is it me
Is it everyone around you

Thank to myself
How mutha fuckin fucked up
The World has become
It seem like violence, is the only things us mutha fuckas know nowaday
Every time I turn around
Everywhere I look
It's anotha mutha fucka killin' anotha mutha fucka
And that's some mutha fuckin' fucked up shit, mutha fucka (Fuck right)
Murder follows me wherever I go

Just the other day
Somebody shot they school up
At least that's what I been hearing everytime I turn the news up
My momma said that there'd be shit like this
I never seen it
C'mon and hit on my blunt and reminice
Now I ask myself
Is there a way to make it stop
A way to make the gats not pop
And is it possible
For me to live the way I need to live
For me to get what I need to get
And give all that I need to give
My situations getting major by the second
That fool that shot his whole school up
Just turned eleven (Whaaa?)
And ain't no body even thinkin' bout it
And for that I hope that every time you sleep you have a dream about it
Up in my hood it's like a warzone
If somebody got a problem with somebody
They don't last long
I seem 'em dyin' every god damn day
And the worst thing about it
I don't think it's shit
I just say it

The way of my love
Is like ultra man meets the sun
I need to be killin' someone
I won't go 2 days without fillin' some graves
Drag 'em in the sewers
My underground caves
I kill a bitch and then hide in my trunk
Except if they come and find me
I will cry like a punk
I just look into the camera
And say mamma I'm sorry
But it's all your fault
You never bought me atari
Murder follows me
Everywhere that I turn

But we never seem to learn
I just attract mad love
Wit my black trucks and black chucks
And what's up
Since I'm strictly givin' no fucks
Murder's on my tail
I don't think I'm gonna last
I'ma leave my lip fatter
Than Rikishi ass

I can't resist that dance
With the devil

I take it, break it down, and analyze it
Manslaughter, murder one, murder two, can't hide it
Everywhere I go vSomebody try and take me
Pistol out my pocket, and I cock it and make 'em history
And there I go
Wizzle, third body today
This how I killin' mutha fuckas
Won't go away
I leave trails every time I walk down the street
Bystanders hoes and dealers stretched out bloody
Leave no traces
And even the cops is paid off

Roughing It Chap. 39,misc,Mark Twain,1872,8,{},"        About seven o'clock one blistering hot morning—for it was now dead summer time—Higbie and I took the boat and started on a voyage of discovery to the two islands. We had often longed to do this, but had been deterred by the fear of storms; for they were frequent, and severe enough to capsize an ordinary row-boat like ours without great difficulty—and once capsized, death would ensue in spite of the bravest swimming, for that venomous water would eat a man's eyes out like fire, and burn him out inside, too, if he shipped a sea. It was called twelve miles, straight out to the islands—a long pull and a warm one—but the morning was so quiet and sunny, and the lake so smooth and glassy and dead, that we could not resist the temptation. So we filled two large tin canteens with water (since we were not acquainted with the locality of the spring said to exist on the large island), and started. Higbie's brawny muscles gave the boat good speed, but by the time we reached our destination we judged that we had pulled nearer fifteen miles than twelve.

        We landed on the big island and went ashore. We tried the water in the canteens, now, and found that the sun had spoiled it; it was so brackish that we could not drink it; so we poured it out and began a search for the spring—for thirst augments fast as soon as it is apparent that one has no means at hand of quenching it. The island was a long, moderately high hill of ashes—nothing but gray ashes and pumice-stone, in which we sunk to our knees at every step—and all around the top was a forbidding wall of scorched and blasted rocks. When we reached the top and got within the wall, we found simply a shallow, far-reaching basin, carpeted with ashes, and here and there a patch of fine sand. In places, picturesque jets of steam shot up out of crevices, giving evidence that although this ancient crater had gone out of active business, there was still some fire left in its furnaces. Close to one of these jets of steam stood the only tree on the island—a small pine of most graceful shape and most faultless symmetry; its color was a brilliant green, for the steam drifted unceasingly through its branches and kept them always moist. It contrasted strangely enough, did this vigorous and beautiful outcast, with its dead and dismal surroundings. It was like a cheerful spirit in a mourning household.

        We hunted for the spring everywhere, traversing the full length of the island (two or three miles), and crossing it twice—climbing ash-hills patiently, and then sliding down the other side in a sitting posture, plowing up smothering volumes of gray dust. But we found nothing but solitude, ashes and a heart-breaking silence. Finally we noticed that the wind had risen, and we forgot our thirst in a solicitude of greater importance; for, the lake being quiet, we had not taken pains about securing the boat. We hurried back to a point overlooking our landing place, and then—but mere words cannot describe our dismay—the boat was gone! The chances were that there was not another boat on the entire lake. The situation was not comfortable—in truth, to speak plainly, it was frightful. We were prisoners on a desolate island, in aggravating proximity to friends who were for the present helpless to aid us; and what was still more uncomfortable was the reflection that we had neither food nor water. But presently we sighted the boat. It was drifting along, leisurely, about fifty yards from shore, tossing in a foamy sea. It drifted, and continued to drift, but at the same safe distance from land, and we walked along abreast it and waited for fortune to favor us. At the end of an hour it approached a jutting cape, and Higbie ran ahead and posted himself on the utmost verge and prepared for the assault. If we failed there, there was no hope for us. It was driving gradually shoreward all the time, now; but whether it was driving fast enough to make the connection or not was the momentous question. When it got within thirty steps of Higbie I was so excited that I fancied I could hear my own heart beat. When, a little later, it dragged slowly along and seemed about to go by, only one little yard out of reach, it seemed as if my heart stood still; and when it was exactly abreast him and began to widen away, and he still standing like a watching statue, I knew my heart did stop. But when he gave a great spring, the next instant, and lit fairly in the stern, I discharged a war-whoop that woke the solitudes!

        But it dulled my enthusiasm, presently, when he told me he had not been caring whether the boat came within jumping distance or not, so that it passed within eight or ten yards of him, for he had made up his mind to shut his eyes and mouth and swim that trifling distance. Imbecile that I was, I had not thought of that. It was only a long swim that could be fatal.

        The sea was running high and the storm increasing. It was growing late, too—three or four in the afternoon. Whether to venture toward the mainland or not, was a question of some moment. But we were so distressed by thirst that we decide to try it, and so Higbie fell to work and I took the steering-oar. When we had pulled a mile, laboriously, we were evidently in serious peril, for the storm had greatly augmented; the billows ran very high and were capped with foaming crests, the heavens were hung with black, and the wind blew with great fury. We would have gone back, now, but we did not dare to turn the boat around, because as soon as she got in the trough of the sea she would upset, of course. Our only hope lay in keeping her head-on to the seas. It was hard work to do this, she plunged so, and so beat and belabored the billows with her rising and falling bows. Now and then one of Higbie's oars would trip on the top of a wave, and the other one would snatch the boat half around in spite of my cumbersome steering apparatus. We were drenched by the sprays constantly, and the boat occasionally shipped water. By and by, powerful as my comrade was, his great exertions began to tell on him, and he was anxious that I should change places with him till he could rest a little. But I told him this was impossible; for if the steering oar were dropped a moment while we changed, the boat would slue around into the trough of the sea, capsize, and in less than five minutes we would have a hundred gallons of soap- suds in us and be eaten up so quickly that we could not even be present at our own inquest.

        But things cannot last always. Just as the darkness shut down we came booming into port, head on. Higbie dropped his oars to hurrah—I dropped mine to help—the sea gave the boat a twist, and over she went!

        The agony that alkali water inflicts on bruises, chafes and blistered hands, is unspeakable, and nothing but greasing all over will modify it—but we ate, drank and slept well, that night, notwithstanding.

        In speaking of the peculiarities of Mono Lake, I ought to have mentioned that at intervals all around its shores stand picturesque turret-looking masses and clusters of a whitish, coarse-grained rock that resembles inferior mortar dried hard; and if one breaks off fragments of this rock he will find perfectly shaped and thoroughly petrified gulls' eggs deeply imbedded in the mass. How did they get there? I simply state the fact—for it is a fact—and leave the geological reader to crack the nut at his leisure and solve the problem after his own fashion.

        At the end of a week we adjourned to the Sierras on a fishing excursion, and spent several days in camp under snowy Castle Peak, and fished successfully for trout in a bright, miniature lake whose surface was between ten and eleven thousand feet above the level of the sea; cooling ourselves during the hot August noons by sitting on snow banks ten feet deep, under whose sheltering edges fine grass and dainty flowers flourished luxuriously; and at night entertaining ourselves by almost freezing to death. Then we returned to Mono Lake, and finding that the cement excitement was over for the present, packed up and went back to Esmeralda. Mr. Ballou reconnoitred awhile, and not liking the prospect, set out alone for Humboldt.

        About this time occurred a little incident which has always had a sort of interest to me, from the fact that it came so near ""instigating"" my funeral. At a time when an Indian attack had been expected, the citizens hid their gunpowder where it would be safe and yet convenient to hand when wanted. A neighbor of ours hid six cans of rifle powder in the bake-oven of an old discarded cooking stove which stood on the open ground near a frame out-house or shed, and from and after that day never thought of it again. We hired a half-tamed Indian to do some washing for us, and he took up quarters under the shed with his tub. The ancient stove reposed within six feet of him, and before his face. Finally it occurred to him that hot water would be better than cold, and he went out and fired up under that forgotten powder magazine and set on a kettle of water. Then he returned to his tub.

        I entered the shed presently and threw down some more clothes, and was about to speak to him when the stove blew up with a prodigious crash, and disappeared, leaving not a splinter behind. Fragments of it fell in the streets full two hundred yards away. Nearly a third of the shed roof over our heads was destroyed, and one of the stove lids, after cutting a small stanchion half in two in front of the Indian, whizzed between us and drove partly through the weather-boarding beyond. I was as white as a sheet and as weak as a kitten and speechless. But the Indian betrayed no trepidation, no distress, not even discomfort. He simply stopped washing, leaned forward and surveyed the clean, blank ground a moment, and then remarked:
        ""Mph! Dam stove heap gone!""—and resumed his scrubbing as placidly as if it were an entirely customary thing for a stove to do. I will explain, that ""heap"" is ""Injun-English"" for ""very much."" The reader will perceive the exhaustive expressiveness of it in the present instance.",148500,en,en,en,

And my basketballs pelt me with bricks in my dreams

Gotta use the weed smoke to replace it And we know that it’s tasteless

And memory traces
And we know it’s the way that it’s gotta be
The only way we can breathe

I feel the heat, while knowing it’s really just in my head
You said you had to leave though it’s brining you grief
You said you’d do it so we could be happy as I could be
Plus, you could see the future of things that I couldn’t see
Now people look at you crazy
Their failure to see how deep
Your feelings just had to be
To be the Villain for me
But you let it go so now I believe
[It’s Summer Love for a season
I can’t believe it, my reasons are deep seeded
It’s something you’d have to see to believe it
And I’ve discovered the reason
That we needed each other love it or leave it
Close your eyes and you’ll uncover the secrets 2x]

You left me cause you could see, the truth That I had to leave you
Said nothing loud as I can, Hoping that I could reach you
Love is blind as a bat, but has the eyes of an eagle
Walking with my eyes closed, half hoping that I could see you
I need you to be here long enough to tell you to go
But leave your essence behind like the cold after the snow
Or a rose after it grows, that’s given out just to be sweet
It’ll be dead in a week, everyone knows
The pleasure in a moment is measured, and I supposed even treasured
Soon as you notice that moments don’t last forever
Knowing that it’s better don’t make it easy to walk away
There are times in life when you have decisions you’ve Got to Make
I just stop and Pray, I left your heart in a proper place
Hope you understand all the things that I never thought to say
I can see you out in the distance telling me not to stray
Proud of my decisions while letting the tears dot your face
Victims of the system are more than the ones locked away
You helped rebuild my life and don’t get the credit or proper grace
And I ain’t saving face, I genuinely know it’s wrong
Fighting for your reason to live before you know it’s gone…
[It’s Summer Love for a season

Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Three Hustla'z was born up in this world of evil
Sanity, humanity's gone up in them suckas tryin' to trigger me
Figure me out? Hell, naw, it'll never happen
Still cappin' them suckas
I got the tear to show I love it, muthafucka
Never once was I hesitant to handle this type of situation
Gimme the grip, I smoke this nigga
Let's roast him

[Tony Tone]
I'm a Hustla, St. Clair nigga, bustin' caps if have to
Niggas that's talkin' that shit
I'm a flip - don't make me kill ya
Smokin' those, buckin' no hoes, that's how I roll
Ready to ride, just bring your guns
I blaze the blunts to get high 'til I die
I'm bustin' through - you never sleep
I creep up at your window to snatch your soul
Then take cash and bail up outta there, I's gone
[Mo! Hart]
We'll I'm known for my flippin' skills
I'm rollin', niggas causin' ruckus
So you best to chill, eliminatin' all suckas at all costs
I pay to be the boss
So, come on, we'll play your game
But it won't be our lives takin' the loss
Sendin' your body into hellified convulsions
Makin' you wish that you had done early mornin' devotion

(Chorus: Flesh)
The St. Clair thugstas for the wasteland
Poetic Hustla'z bring, and suddenly all of my gang from C-town
Ready to get beat down with bats and chains

Ready to get beat down with bats and chains

Now you can tell there's a time on a brother if you wanna
Now be willing to face the consequences
If I show ya behind the scenes of a genius
I's a Hustla, muthafucka
Never trust ya for nothin'
Because you bustas hatin' Hustla'z
You're suckas, for one
I can fuck your bitch, for two, and it's true
[Flesh]
Like TNT, my crew blew up
Nothin' for you, but destruction
Daily kabash, now let me tell you somethin'
If you ain't down with the click, start shit, and I'm dumpin'
Pump, pump with the Mossy shotty
Thought that they got me, but I'm a roll
So dare and step up, with my pistol, grip up
Well, instead, anybody better beware
Don't stare when I'm bailin' down your block
You stop, you look, and then very soon drop
Way back in the day they called me B.B. Rock
I'm tryin' to stop any fools who thought that he was livin'
Turned his back on stacks, to the bloodshed
I stop 'em and make sure they come back

[Tony Tone]
Murder crawls on the streets
I roll with heat, and watch my back
At all times for the shyste muthafucka's
Tryin' to sneak a TEC with his mind
Remember this: don't let me bring that ho up outta your soul
When it's time to roll
My St. Clair niggas'll point with straight up gun control
Ammunition that'll blow you away
You niggas test, got blessed when you lay in your grave
'Cause crime pays
[Mo! Hart]
Callin' me out on the dance floor, nigga
You know we 'bout to prance
But the outcome ain't shit closed to what you planned
Mesmerizin', your ass left in total confusion
Should've read the instructions good, 'cause you're losin'
I've never bothered nobody until they bother me
Especially now, 'cause I'm in this fuckin' industry

(Chorus)

[Boogy Nikke]
Giddy-up, muthafucka, 'fore I diss ya
You ain't got the heart to drink the blood
I can't trust ya, muthafucka
Gotta know who I'm rollin' with be soldiers for me, the B-double O-G
Yeah, I'm in your veins, die nigga
What you wanna do?
I run everything from Mississippi from the bitches to you
I got my clip packed straight in my hip
Ready to dip on them suckas that be set-trippin', rippin', and dippin'

[Mo! Hart]
Commonly known to the foes, nigga, my name is Mo (Mo)
Don't ever get the impression that I'm some kind of ho
'cause once you cross that line
You'll be the victim of your own demise
This means you're gonna die for fuckin' with a cool-ass little nigga like me
Just throw up your right fist when I roll through your street
Didn't wish to be violent, but don't think that I'm tame
Muthafucka, wail his ass with a bang

[Tony Tone]
Niggas is pissin' me off
So my actions are based on reality
Society makes this world we live today in a fuckin' tragedy
Niggas is killin' each other for the root of all evil, the same sequel
Back in the days, you wanna get paid?
You had to do some evil, anything to make your life go foward
We'll run over what's not in order
Mo Thug's in charge, we're rebels
And St. Clair soldiers, comin' from these Cleveland streets
We can't be beat

Dial killa for murda once, no redial
Just see child, the O G style and how I used to be wild
This the story of Cam'ron and Zeke Giles one way road to the P now
Yea the whoscal, ohh child you wasn't there
Zeke snitched, if he did, I'd be doin a hundred years
Did the interstate, big cities, tiny ones
Took over niggas towns, black ties, tiny bums
Handsome hoods, pretty thugs, but we grimy dun
Cars, cribs, money, had to find me some
Zeke right behind me dun dun, he play by all the rules
That's why the house is his, the cars, all the jewels
Ya'll niggas all are fools, your regular married with children
Dawg, nine to five, office, pool
Couldn't live that life, I needa loft and pool
I had too much class, I ain't report to school
If they report to school, I caught the stool, extort the fool
Took off his jewels, thought he cool, gun to mouth, they often drool
Fuckin wit this wolf, this should be taught to you
Ya money don't matter, what you can't afford to do
Is fuck wit me dawg, that could be affordable
Hide ya mom, police protection, that's when I'm cordial
Cars convertible, TV's are portable
Fiends on line, coke lines, they come and snort a few

I was forced to eat, anything you lost I keep
Shot the fifth, and then like a Piston, toss the Heat (Bye)
Now round the corner, up the block, cross the street
Up fifty flights, iight where the bosses meet
And the Porsche is peach, felt like Boston George
Left Boston Market, did deals on Boston Beach
Now I bought the beach, all because they applaud my speech

Why Am I Not Good Enough- Poem,misc,Aiden Estrada,2021,15,{},"Again, another day where you get up feeling like crap
Makeup, not too much, you'll look like a whore
Too little, you'll look like a boar
You spend hours trying to get it right
You put on an outfit
Not too short, not too showy
Something uncomfortable

When you're you pretend not to hear the whispers
You pretend you don't feel their eyes
You hang with your ""friends""
Who you don't like, so maybe you'll be liked
Because they're the popular kids
They are known by everyone, so if they're your ""friends""
maybe people will like you

Lunch. You don't eat. You didn't eat breakfast
You're hungry but if you eat you'll get fat

Home. When you're here you go straight to your room
It's time to take off the makeup and those tight uncomfortable jeans
This might have taken hours, but
when you look at yourself one last time, you know you look bad
You say to yourself, ""Why am I not good enough?""

When you dress down
you stop pretending
you let it out
you scream and cry
you can't pretend, not anymore
It's bubbling out,
""Why am I not good enough?""
You go to sleep knowing you have to do it all again

Knowing, thinking, feeling
""Why am I not good enough?""",6381549,en,en,en,

Understanding that who was once president of the United States

Who use to be the president of the United States is a rapist
Bad news for Hillary
I understand
If you would have an affair
It would make sense
I don't condone but you couldn't resist

There could've been hundreds we don't even know

I can't even stand
You make me sick

Support your crooked wife
If you slept around and forced favors on girls

You wanted it bad
What you had in front of you but some that refused you still had to get

Smoking a Cuban cigar

You had enough
Your the president and you wanted to cum
So you got a secretary and that ended as so...

What's morbid is there's poets who want to be on the Forbes List
I will be gorgeous and homeless
Stealing from your fortress
Bad habits, no abacus
But we asking why would the Devil need a advocate?
How you bald, busting hat tricks?
Sharpshooter versus mavericks
Hyphens and asterisks
Footnotes and post-scripts
My muffin grilled not toasted
Suit piece and a shiner
Laughter in Marcy's Diner type tempo
All these tiny mementos, I'm always dusting
Malafide husbandry
Corner hustling, as in not busking
The clattering of guillotines in the backdrop of whatever it is you're building

Exiled in the X-Files
R.A.P. Ferreira will rap forever
The cinematic speaker, wall gazer poet

Respect means a lot to you
So the sense that, ""I'm taken seriously and respected for my work""
You can read this in my face?
Yeah
Huh
I can read it in terms of what's been written about you and what you've said
And I took that right outta your piece
Where do they come from?
They look like caricatures of used car dealers from Dallas
And sweet Jesus, there are a hell of a lot of them at 4:30 on a Sunday morning
Still humping the American Dream
That vision of the big winner somehow emerging from the last minute pre-dawn chaos at a stale Vegas casino
Spinning the wheel, spinning the wheel, spinning the wheel
Make me rich, make me very rich
Oh, you bastard
No, no calm down

From laughing with preachers of night
With my vertebrae twisted
From dancing with creatures of night
A day away from sanctified

From turning the pages of sin

From earning the wages of sin

Now she send blood through my artery
She start piecing me up
With that a pierce on her tongue
While we listen to r&b
Back of the benz got her hands on the roof
Ask her my name and she told me the TRUTH
Rounds had to roll windows down for it boof
Now that I put the shit down I’m aloof
Bands on me
You hear the horns and the drums when I step in the room
Damn homie that bullshit don’t bother me Nun I just skip to my loot

Cool young man he the key and the locksmith
We at ease like a soldier that’s marchin
We got real vaccine fuck faucci

Now they look cross eyed they watching my movements
Know I’m the first and the last one to do this
Built up the building then burnt up the blueprint
I got at least 50 hoes in the bag
Smack on her ass she get wet like a fountain
I don’t time for the screaming and shouting
Pass her a rag put that shit where her mouth is
No I don’t chase em they fall in my lap

I’m goin for the gold medal got my hand on my heart
And i swear down i’m gonna go hard
Until i’m dearly departed
I’m so excited
I think it’s bout time i had a little celebration and you’re all invited
I couldn’t give a damn not even the slightest
My swags on point and my flows the tightest
I’ll never sell my soul god helped me write this
Plus i know what a fight is
I been through the struggle
In and out of trouble
Couple of close calls
But you can’t hear the pain anymore in my vocals
It ain’t even because of the pro tools
In total I feel so complete with life its sweet
You gotta scream
Scream it from your heart
Feel it from your soul
Scream it from your heart

Feel it from your heart
Scream it from your soul
Feel it from your heart

I coulda drowned in the blood and the sweat
But instead i show the world i don’t pet

Nobody can’t mess with my rep
Nah I’m a seasoned vet
And I’m the best i’m as good as it gets
I’m the champion now
So I don’t care who they call next
I’ve earned my respect
Now they’re loving the way i flex
Run up in the offices they’re writing a major cheque
So it doesn’t matter about the butterflies in my solar plex
Never the nervous wreck
Cool and calm
Keep sharp and focused and stay out of harm
Plus i can’t be rocked
You know i’m far too hot to be given the drop
Stay better then i’m never gonna give up the top spot
I’m keeping the spot locked

World wide peoples livin is wack
It’s bigger than grime and bigger than rap
People living in crap
No fresh water out of the tap
Plus they’re being attacked what kinda living is that
Look anywhere in the map
Too many young boys stuck in the trap
Too many young boys running round strapped
Ready to clap
Too many young girls fall in the gap
They’re fallin for chat from dumb cats that need to fall back
Think about life cause there ain’t no re run
No dvd no second season

God's chosen parasites gather
Beyond the burning skies of the utmost north
The descent of a sun...of flesh and blood

Spawn of damnation's bride
Line of the cockatrice

Behold the bond-slaves of the vampire star
Behold the twin-river demon
And now a flash-flood of rot and of human tar
The temple of Mammon...still standing tall

Web woven from the trust of the viper
Rope made from the pride of a rat
Serving as knights of the illusion
Chosen as lords of the great lie

By ancient law we've lost our right to exist
For have we not brought upon ourselves damnation?
Yet we never expected Hell to look like this
An inferno with flames...of flesh and blood
Breed of deception's tribe

Numb in the poisonous net of Sirion's will
Stuck in the snares of the hidden hand
And as the true blood of the north is frozen still
The tower of the flame...is bound to fall

Held in contempt

That you had never been born

Baby, don’t take your love out on me
I don’t understand ‘cause I ain’t done nothing, you see
She said, that’s exactly what I mean
And I said, Baby, just don’t take your love out on me

Some say I’m lazy or crazy for drinking alone
But I wouldn’t do it if I had someone to drink with at home
But she’s always working so hard, it’s breaking my heart
And the older I get, the more things start falling apart

Baby, don’t take your love out on me…

I think I remember forgetting to leave the light on
Or maybe I forgot to remember to stop thinking at all
What can you say when you’re wasting away every night
And why can’t I remember to think of things right
When I was a kid, I was dreaming
A particular song in my head
I sit here today and I see that I’m singing
That very same song to bring home my bread

Overcomplicate it

Known only for fury

Colossal bloodbath has begun
Perpetually I will be known

Ravens circle in the skies
Valour is recognised as nobility
Witness the fire in my eyes
And you will find your tranquillity

The final stand is upon us now
Faced with cowardice from the weak
So many men it takes to bring me down
Surprise assault from the south

See the fire in my spirit strengthening

Dissolution of the nameless foes

What you do with people who are afraid and-and to some degree depressed, but certainly anxious is: you lay out what-what they're anxious about first of all in-in detail what is it that you're afraid of, what might happen, and then you decompose it into a small problem
And then you have the person expose themselves to the thing they're afraid of and what happens is that they get less afraid, that's what the clinical literature indicates exactly
What happens instead is that they get braver

If she selfish, you wouldn’t walk over

Will it go to plan or cascade off it

Verse 2:

You‘re too proud of yourself
To go back to a sideline
Expiration dates ain’t got nothing  to do with a life time
You been through hell
And now you’re done with insecurity
The only one you need is you
That what it’s meant to be
You don’t need nigga who keeps you on stand -by
Another lying nigga, like the one from last time
All you wanted was a happy home
That’s picture perfect
A man you can look up to, hiding place, you derserve it
Love and trust, maybe a ring on your finger
A flower that grows & gets realer and realer
Maybe the most feelings through healing
Answers of the higher power when you pray to the ceilings
But most of all you need yourself in the first place
You just wanna be free in the first case
You always gotta beat the odds on these worst days

Bubba Jones,rock,Tony Joe White,2021,267,{},"[Verse 1]
Bubba Jones was a good 'ole boy
Lived back in the woods
Drove a 4-wheel drive pickup
Kept it running good

[Verse 2]
Had a little 'ole 5-horse Mercury
The thing was bad to smoke
Spent his spare time fishing
In a 10-foot aluminum boat

[Bridge]
Cause there was a lot of money to be had
For the man who caught the world record large-mouth bass

[Verse 3]
Bubba had a dream one night
Everything seemed surreal
He caught a bass that weighed 25 pounds
On a Zebco spinning reel
He was getting anxious
But he waited till the moon was right
He loaded up his truck and boat
Headed out before daylight
[Bridge]
He stopped for bologna and crackers, and a little gas
And he was off to catch a world record large-mouth bass

[Verse 4]
He had a small fortune in plastic worms, auto fishing lures
He's throwing them hard, and throwing them long
Nothing was doin' no good
Then he looked inside his tackle box
Seen a lure his grandpa made
He tied it on and he let it go
Over in a cyprus shade

[Bridge]
He let it sit real still, wiggled it kinda slow
Then it seemed like the whole lake exploded
And it shook him down to his toes
Bubba said mmm..
Believe I got something here that might last
It just might be the world record large-mouth bass

[Verse 5]
But he knew he was in trouble
Knew it was out of hand
When it almost jerked him out of his boat
That's when he swallowed his Redman
And that 'ole bass came up on top of the water
Started dancing his tail
And it sounded something like
Bubba, Bubba, Bubba, Bubba, Bubba
[Verse 6]
Well it broke his line and blew his mind
Then he started to shake
But he finally got ahold of himself
Had a little Gatorade
Bubba was down and out, but he had class
When he shook his fist and said
I'll be back for the world record large-mouth bass

Diancecht forge me a new arm!

Sparks and embers ignite

Seek your father

They left on a silver vessel
To the lands of the Fomor and their king
Upon reaching Fomorian shores

And he sent him to meet

My coughing would not stop as I rubbed bloodshot eyes
My hair began falling out
It fell in clumps lightly to the floor
I was so high I stopped even trying to think

The mental doorway in my mind gave away
Bloodcurdling visions of pain and death
An overwhelming urge taking over my thoughts
We must shed blood to please the reefer gods

No longer in control
I limped strangely out of my front door
I went outside
Tonight someone I know will die!

I paid no heed to the chaos all around me
Explosions rumbled in the distance but I did not care
A brick that was lying in some rubble
Smashed a neighbor's window so I could get inside

I knew the family was hiding in the basement
They would be a sacrifice
To my new master now
So with a steak knife I stole out of their kitchen

I sliced their fucking throats!",4024501,en,en,en,2ZP7G9wMaS8bKMnIzpip88
Cant Sing Straight,pop,Teddy Thompson,2008,105,{},"I been drinking so much I can't sing straight
Gotta hope that it's not too late

You're not really gonna take it away just yet

I just did what I thought I could (get away with)

Never had much of a wild side to tame
But I grew up pretty and tall and fine

Give me one more chance to get things right

He laughed an evil laugh, (hahahahah) I felt his dark and hostile stare (evil)
He kicked me in the stomach and he grabbed me by my hair (ow)
He scalped me very slowly, I felt all my flesh just tear (arghhh)

Why Am I So Lovely? Because My Master Washes Me.,pop,Bosse-de-Nage,2011,493,{},"At twilight, those who play in the water touch the moon on its waves. In bed, those who lay on the covers hallucinate their existence. A conversation with the slave who fought to save the work from a fire. At midnight, those who play in the dust grasp the wind by its hair. In emptiness, those who die drain their bodies into a bowl left beside the bed. At dawn, the tree that still grows gropes the world with its leaves",1419316,en,en,en,6ea6MNSBUHezdL14oJxlYl
Mic Like a Memory Deluxe Edition feat. Kory Calico,pop,CunninLynguists,2015,42,{},"[Chorus]x2
I sign his space's with time existant blare
I hold the mic like a memory

[Deacon the Villan]
There was a time when I couldn't find energy
The only person that was filln' me was Mrs. Hennesey
Ahh, it's like life was pinnin' me down
I used to gout on the town and get instantly clowend
You ain't gonna be a rapper, you not a factor
You just a kentucky boy, get yourself a tractor
Chasing out the bogus dreams that you never acheive
Thats when the liquer and weed became a need
Self-esteem was about as low as ??
Aspirations were about as big as Myrtle Urkel's titties
Then as soon as I started geeting some pride
My sister hydroplaned and died on I-65
In a family full of pride, house full of tears
Spent many years with a blood stream of beers
Heart full of fears all jeers, no cheers
Till the rhythm in my ears make my mind clear
[Chorus]x2
[Dj Kno]
Ayo, I hold the microphone enclosed in my palm
And go beyond the flows exposed in my songs
Can't grow fond of past memories
Cause negativity leads the way to live with vast energy
Offended by the mental imagery
And suggest livin' in poverty was really meant for me
Paternal tendancies towards chemical dependancies had me thinking that all
My enemies work into me
And I can't begin to see how to control the flash backs
And progress past, all my style of dress got me laughed at
Thought I was passed at
But it attemps to reoccur when I dont proceive what I feel I deserve
Being slurred by those not livin' in my position
My thoughts tend to glisten, Just like a pot to piss in
And when I thought I'd risin', life freeze's the frame
So I hold the mic like a memory to ease th pain

[Chorus]x2
[Kory Calico]
I sit back on the flip, on the wild paths in my life
Only pain and heartache can feel my paths on the right
You know wat blasphermy's like, cursing the god
Cause you ain't got shit it hurts and its hard
Hell at times I steped it up to only stumble
Was forced to play tarzan in this concrete jungle
Most of my life's a daze got me forever lighting haze
Trying to forget the times, where I barely ate twice a day
For, alone and helpless, so when I only felt the shame
Sharing a twin bed in a homeless shelter
Few friends even then, most homies is fake
Feel like a prisoner in my home pencil my only escape
I went from the block with my fam, to college exams
But the pressures still there
Dog, I'm still scared
But I know it will all be right in the end
As long as I can focus my fears and channel my life through my pen",1996463,en,en,en,

I hear they're gonna tear down those apartments
They're pulling every single plank
It's where we set
It's where we met, it's where we drank

I hear they're gonna hollow out the middle
It's gonna be a parking lot
They said the doors were weak
The roof would leak and the floors were rot

You said we were invincible
But my hair is falling out
She screamed, ""My life is so miserable
I'm so lonely in this house.""

I guess this is the end of days
This is all we talk about
But I love you more than I did before

Hear they put up rows and rows of houses
In the field where we once played
Well, they dug up bones to build their homes
So nothing's safe
I remember ducking barbed wire fences
Crossing through the creek
And waiting there in that night air
To watch you breathe

And you said we were invincible
But my hair is falling out
And she screamed, ""My life is so miserable
I'm so lonely in this house.""

Well, I guess this is the end of days
Since it's all we talk about
But I love you more than I did before

I'm growing like a garden
Every year we both would change
Till we both were grown
The field was gone, the lit was paved

I remember summer moving quickly
And the bad times just got worse
But the love we had when times were bad
Could quench our thirst

And you said we were invincible
But my hair is falling out
And she screamed, ""My life is so miserable
I'm so lonely in this house.""
Well, I guess this is the end of days
Since it's all we talk about

He was hit by lightning now he's faster
As a meta-human saving Central City from disaster
With the Science people who work at the fancy laboratory
Who are all attractive, only to distract you from the story

His folks were ripped away (Too sad)
He fights crime every day (So rad)

Traveling through time and Alternate Dimensions in a jiffy
Facing different metas also he is married to his sister
That's right, his sister

They're not technically related but they both grew up together
Hot as they may be as grown adults, It doesn't make It better
They both went through puberty while living in the same abode

And sharing the same father who is cool with this whole scenario And still respected as a Lawman
Where's the common sense in that?
And brainy nerds at Star, don't Have the basic concept of a Social Norm
Anyway the show has crazy stuff like Human Sharks and also Blindly just allows two legal siblings to get freaking married

Supremacists have forced us to align
With fear itself the poisoner
The final level with no front lines
Epochal evil spirits of depression
Breaking free

Watch a massacre becoming cultural genocide
Lost rebel youth demonized

Focused on destruction
Troops are blasting silhouettes
Vile aggressors slaughter

This is Dr. Whitebred. A multidisciplinary session. IMF. Group therapy. It’s been a long time coming

[Verse 1 – Hermitofthewoods]
My name is Michael Douglas McGuire
The bird of fire, the liar, the Sire
Mired in funeral pyres the choir the quiet
The riot in the inner mind’s wires
Iron Alliances – I am eye of the tiger –
The line where violence lives
A scientist of silences
Been rhyming since 96 I’m an arsonist
Burning myself is all part of it
Third degree survivor this is dire, inspired but tired
Im trying, but I left it behind when I was dying

[Verse 2 – Queen V]
Vanessa Ann Marie Furlong
Sagittarian, arrogant and headstrong
Cause if there’s a way
There’s a will go wrong
I found redemption in the pills popped and hip hop
And it’s on
Forgiven and given a mic
So I’m living and driven in spite
Of the hidden forbidden
[?] that I fight
Cause this life dragged me down its path
Kicking and screaming, so I fight
[Dr. Whitebred]
IMF. Group therapy. It’s been a long time coming

[Verse 3 – EMC]
My name is Eric Vincent McIntyre
Been sending smoke signals as my ashtray piles
[?] now I can’t go outside
Without my headphones a refuge for my thoughts to exercise
Track meet, move feet eternal sunshine beats
Art is sparked, less mind more heart, buried deep
That thing we had is dead and it won‘t rest in peace
Now coffins rest between my eyelids when I try to go to sleep

[Verse 4 – Heartz]
Heartz Aoi Deadwood
Useless, unmotivated, broke
Undeserving of kudos
Manic depressive, suicidal failure
Unseen
Leave me to drown here
Moves only in dead backward steps
Each breath, only to strangle my own neck
And cut the rope before I cross over
I just can’t win
Thank you
[Dr. Whitebred]
IMF. Cooking up some psycho soup!

[Verse 5 – Rah-kleus]
Christopher Thomas Rice, that’s what they named me
And I've been playing nice too long for you to save me
We want a say “they said”
So I’m here breaking it down with like nunchucks upside the head
Guess again, there there, doubting Thomas with a promise Breaking habit to tendency-- misanthropic dependency
You talking therapy? Got six bitches sharing me
Behind closed doors and guarantees and I ain't made a peep!

[Verse 6 – Quimbo]
My name is Michael Gray Kimber
I've whined long enough so fuck it
This is group therapy
What do you call it? With co-dependency, I can dodge it
Group therapy
We’re all fucked up, wow, I got it
Clarity losers are getting rich
Masters of speaking hoping to be living as giant soliloquies
Possibility is limitless but the world shit on us
I can’t make a crown out of all the feces
I need people to need me
So promise me you’ll meet me
Where I’ll be in constant company, my home
The asylum with my best friends, world full of ripples
Scared to walk in my own shoes
Without the crutches to carry this cripple

Only your mama gave you time before the sickness attacked
She had the business you had school it was an easy detachment
I know you love your mother, but the truths who you married
And that’s why you don’t have a friend coz your burden is heavy

Throw your tears in the sea with the pains of what you'll never reveal

Blessed in this booth with with the everflowing wisdom of gods
You carry the weight of the whole race on the blades of your shoulders
How you slave so they understand that the searching is over
Cry Jahlil!
They only use you for passion these niggas these niggas lazy to get it
I seen the scars on your heart how they make you a legend
I seen your bandwagon grow they try to make your acquaintance
Smile Jahlil!
You were heard by Dre, it's kinda poetic Chronic lit your way
You were heard by the Wyshmaster and he sent you a track
You done what they never did its why they show you respect!

I see the dream, I'm not the only one
If you believe it's real, just like the rising sun
We could be free, leave all the clouds behind
No need to fear, come, put your hand in mine

[Chorus: Massari]
(Eh-na-na, oh-na-na) We want peace
(Eh-na-na, oh-na-na) All over the world

[Verse 2: Ali Gatie]
(Listen) This a song for anybody losin' hope
Kids that nеver met their family at all
Mothеrs who had sons that never came home
For all the kids who grew up in war
This a song for anybody with a dream
Fathers working hard 'cause they got families to feed
Mothers who had to bury their own child
I could never ever feel how you feel
Matter fact this a song for my people of color
I could never forget all my black sisters and brothers
I'ma use my voice 'til the day I die
I stand with Yemen, with Palestine
For my people in Iraq and Lebanon
Just know that your voices are heard and it's hella strong
We want peace, we ain't giving up
I'ma say it one more time, we ain't ever giving up

You don't mind standing, looking that person dead in the eye

And tell them you really love them
How many of you woman out there have been in love before
You know the minute you love that someone so much
There is nothing in the world you wouldn't do for them
You cook the food, put it in the table for them, wash their dirty clothes
Nothing in the world you wouldn't do for that love
But deep down in your heart you know that that some don't care a dog' gon thing about you
Now you can't help but cry sometimes
But you know what, if you see them with someone else
You know you love them, you know you got to be jealous of them
Because when you love someone, you don't want nobody else to have your love
And that's why I got to stand up today baby and tell you something like this
You know what, I'm so jealous
Yes I am, I'm so jealous of you baby
Yes I am, I'm not ashamed to admit it baby
No I'm not, I don't mind standing up and telling the whole world about it
Can't you see me down on my knees crawling to you baby
Baby I love you I love you I love you
Sometimes I got it all night long
But I don't mind crying for you baby
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute

You know what, I can't help it, but I got to say it
Once I was in love with a woman
I didn't have sense enough to know how much she meant to me
You know what, when I saw her with someone else
I didn't know what love was
How much love was to be jealous of her
But when that woman out and left me standing alone
Do you know I began to burn all inside
And I just like to walk over and hold your hand
And I like to tell you something like this
I like to say baby, baby, oh baby
I just want to be your man, can I be your man baby
And she looked at me with tears in her eyes
And these are the words that she began to say

She began to say, oh baby I'm so jealous
I'm so jealous of you honey, I don't want nobody else to have you

Look, I know you can't tell what kind of position I'm in
With all of this in-side, I’m this high
But it feels like I'm drowning within
Look at me grin- no
It's fake, I do it so I can fit in
You would not know unless if I told you that
I am surrounded by sin
I am surrounded by past events that I can't even escape
All of this hate is deep inside of me

Without me sighing
Without me wishing of dying

We thought it was the great snake digging holes

She grew wild

The rumors in this town never seem to last
She knew just enough to fill her lungs and tell us all:
Leave gold in the hills for islands in the Midwest

They were wasted, with two looks on their facе
Staring at each other, someday I'll gеt away

If I hit one more close I'll wander down these frozen roads with you
Barely high enough to see
But slow the darkness goes, and not a soul will even know if you
Were hanging next to me

She drew space between the houses
On all the faces you let in
[?] stand alone in [?] towns and broken homes
Where no one waits to see what's next

Dust stil coats the shades and photographs
But she was free at last of living with an epitaph
While you got old, she got fast

We tie our lives to paradigms and trust that they’ll be true

Only our views do

Take a bite of the sounds they want you to hear
Take the fight to the ground where they disappeared

Take a light to the houses they built from glass
Can’t burn it down, but crank it loud, it’ll melt fast

I’m not a voice that matters
So don’t take it from me

But boy you must be scatterbrained be unable to see

Nothing can tip the balance
The scales aren’t anywhere
And the stars show up to twinkle way out there and we say

Roses can be red

Hear all the same fools saying the backs of their minds

They only draw the constellations they were given

They’re fucking sickening

The Broken Tower,misc,Hart Crane,2013,942,{},"The bell-rope that gathers God at dawn
Dispatches me as though I dropped down the knell
Of a spent day - to wander the cathedral lawn
From pit to crucifix, feet chill on steps from hell.

Have you not heard, have you not seen that corps
Of shadows in the tower, whose shoulders sway
Antiphonal carillons launched before
The stars are caught and hived in the sun's ray?

The bells, I say, the bells break down their tower;
And swing I know not where. Their tongues engrave
Membrane through marrow, my long-scattered score
Of broken intervals… And I, their sexton slave!

Oval encyclicals in canyons heaping
The impasse high with choir. Banked voices slain!
Pagodas, campaniles with reveilles out leaping-
O terraced echoes prostrate on the plain!…

And so it was I entered the broken world
To trace the visionary company of love, its voice
An instant in the wind (I know not whither hurled)
But not for long to hold each desperate choice.
My word I poured. But was it cognate, scored
Of that tribunal monarch of the air
Whose thigh embronzes earth, strikes crystal Word
In wounds pledged once to hope - cleft to despair?

The steep encroachments of my blood left me
No answer (could blood hold such a lofty tower
As flings the question true?) -or is it she
Whose sweet mortality stirs latent power?-

And through whose pulse I hear, counting the strokes
My veins recall and add, revived and sure
The angelus of wars my chest evokes:
What I hold healed, original now, and pure…

And builds, within, a tower that is not stone
(Not stone can jacket heaven) - but slip
Of pebbles, - visible wings of silence sown
In azure circles, widening as they dip

The matrix of the heart, lift down the eye
That shrines the quiet lake and swells a tower…
The commodious, tall decorum of that sky
Unseals her earth, and lifts love in its shower.",107074,en,en,en,

Have you ever seen the like of this mankind?
If a boy or girl is cute, we simply shoot to starry heights
Any maybe, any might
But always so capricious, in the face of wonder we're suspicious
And though we came from frogs and fishes
Our taste is far from fine
Put your big toe in the milk of human kindness
Put your big toe in the milk of human kindness
Have you ever seen the like of this mankind?
You take the Himalayas, you'll take Manhattan's finest mountain top
He wouldn't change his whiskey sour for any bitter crop

[Chorus][x2]
But always so contrary, from Father Christmas to the Virgin Mary
And though the moments of belief
Fly by before you find if you'd just unhand your mind
Put your big toe in the milk of human kindness",462434,en,en,en,5DryPucHlk1h9m0OkFf3do

Burdens to bear
All awaiting
Our own electric chair

Time refuses anyone's return
Time's a hollow demon
Slowly rotting everything
In sight

Twin birth

That you'll die

With time they slowly drifted away
From the all embracing light
To the darkness of the night

Dancing forward toward the dawn, wrapped in coats of vanity
In the closets, in the home hang the toasts of days gone by
Breaking every haunted scheme, confusing thoughts with fantasy

This is the modern world
This is the modern world
This is the modern world

In the back rooms, where they wait, keeping time so patiently
Playing cards and casting lots sit the last of [Unverified]
In their confusion to deceive, they miss the point so handily
Filling every secret need, they succeed perfectly

If I didn't drive my car so much
Or I could meet you in the store

Maybe you're my childhood friend
Who I have always thought about
It's really time I figure that one out

I pray the lord every night, He don't get rid of you
I know the situation that I'm in making you miserable
And these are my apologies
I'm sorry Niya for all the shit I did to you
And when a nigga was broke all the shit I couldn't give to you
And every day you go away you know yo daddy missing you
I know I should've been there but...
These are my apologies

Verse 1
I been through alot shit with my O.G
She left me in a cell like she didn't know me
500 for my bail I had to do a whole week
I didn't know then but now I'm thinking slowly
Low key she was teaching me on how to be a man
If you get caught then do that bid, better be glad that it wasn't them feds
If you got two feet then yo ass gone stand, if you aim for the moon where you think you gone land
Get up off yo ass and get up out that jam, Damn!
She said you know I love you but this is tough love
The journey through my life it was a rough one
Coming from the world where the daddies don't love sons
And Momma got be the daddy too, and that fucked up
But much love, for schooling me on what's what
And when that nigga used to beat on you I never punked up
Smack my baby moms sold dope even tried to rob
But for the most part raising me you did a great job
Chorus 1x

Verse 2
Lil Niya what's going on, surviving just cause we strong
My Diamond heir to the throne, while rhyming to get us on
I try not to never roam, yo momma I loved her so
She promise to never go, she left me cold and alone
But Daddy was doing wrong, I was creeping not coming home
And a couple of fucked up shit to embarrassed to let you know
I was fucking up in school, getting treed and staying broke
Owning up to my mistakes gotta do it because I'm grown
Driven by self passion while dying from bad habits
Surrounded by lick hitter and niggas that bag cabage
Provoked by pot heads, pill poppers, and crack addicts
To get a elbow and a scale jo and start trappin
But my daughter need me here make sure she good and well
Rather be broke in the hood than to be broke in a cell
Who going look after you if I'm sitting in a jail
Yo Daddy was real nigga but only time will tell

Chorus 1x

Verse 3
Pardon me, my bad, and my apologies
I'm sorry the people I hurt and I proud to be
A trifling ass nigga, a lying ass nigga
A dead beat, broke ass, fighting ass nigga
But I'm trying my nigga shit I'm only human
If you don't like it my nigga what can I do then
Push forward fuck the past keep it moving
I'm in the game but it feel like I'm losing
I'm still young, I'm still dumb, wild and stupid
Ain't man enough to say sorry, I express it through this music
Good Queen I misused and abuse them
Taking out frustration on people that didn't do shit
My emotions I neglect and push to the side
With a build in notion that man don't cry
And when men don't cry, we pretend and don't pray
And push the one we love the most the farther-est away

What You Started,rap,Stayii,2018,24,{},"//Verse 1
You ain't telling me shit
Wave away when you sail away and someday
You'll be feeling this shit
Pay wave, no cheque
Same day, you forget
Imma put the pay with day and all that
Treat 'em all the same way and all that
They can go complain away then all slack
I'm building bonds and I'm building trust
But the only thing, I ain't do is rush
At the top, there's only few of us
We start somewhere like a student does
Starting at the top makes me furious
I started with my boy only two of us
It won't be long, till we get a tour bus
Didn't want the hype but sure it was a good buzz
Check the cheque, be it kudos
""Lips or the neck? Please include both.""
Imma taking all this shit
Why you being a little bitch?
Bet you only wanted to be in the crew though
//Hook
Bitch you ain't say shit to me
Bet you wanted something. Right?
Take you on a trip with me and
We'll do something good all night

//Verse 2
People want to be in my flow, aye
They go crazy when I say no, aye
Forcing me to treat them like vros, aye
Bitch I work for the dough and I'm treated like a pro. Aye
They say money talks but you say nothing
Isa o dalawa? I say doble o nada
I say me gusta el viento. They don't where I been though
Been breezy all out of the window
Australia heat in the bin though
Cat catacombs
Closing the tomb, lock in the dough
Travel out here, we'll fill you with fear
Come right here we'll make you disappear

//Hook x2
Bitch you ain't say shit to me
Bet you wanted something. (Right? x1)
Take you on a trip with me and
We'll do something good all night
//Verse 3
We'll create great memories
Share between the two of us
Thanks for staying next to me
You make me feel important
Picture just in the moment
And I don't mean to be blunt
But staying with you forever
Would be better if they knew of us
Widen, living, view of our society
Closing, dying, invasion of our privacy
Caging of notoriety and finally being approved
Moved by our fantasy and viewed as our insanity
Yeah

//Outro
Thanks for talking shit to me
At least I gave what you wanted
Live and dream on this memory
Never forget what you started",3525604,en,en,en,

One more night I wonder why
One more hope I hope for

One more reason to hide

Lost someone whose settling down
One more face to forget now

Add it to the wounds that got me here

Maybe I will

When I don't need it anymore
And I don't need you anymore

Maybe I'll get it right

One more small step forward
It's not easy but I'm getting by

One more blink of my eye

In a faded envelope
In a vice-like grip

The passage
Of a carriage in the dark
On a foreign trip (again)

The image
Of a figure in the trees
In the evening rain

The knowledge
Of a stranger in your midst
On a speeding train (again)

Night train

He senses
Perfume lingers in the night
Smell of French cologne
He watches
As a hand turns down the light
Leaves him all alone (again)

He whispers
In a dim lit empty room
But it's all in vain

He laughs
When he reads the note he finds
On the midnight train (again)

So long ago, when I was small
All summer long it had a fair
Wonderful fair with swings and all

I used to love that little fair
And at the close of everyday
I could be found, dancing around
A merry-go round that used to play

""Ah, mon amour
A toi toujours
Rien que nous deux
Rien, rien, rien, que nous deux""

All summer long that little fair
Made everyday like a holiday
And night after night it used to play
People came there from so far away

And everyone sang that little tune
And all around town you heard it played
Even Pepi from Napoli
He sang to Marie
This serenade
""Ah, mon amour
A toi toujours""

Even Pepi from Napoli
He sang to Marie
This serenade

If the sun should tumble from the sky
If the sea should suddenly run dry
If you love me, let it happen
Let it happen darling, I won't care

Shall I catch a shooting star
Shall I bring it where you are
If you want me to, I will
You can set me any task
I'll do anything you ask
If you'll only love me still

When at last
Our life on earth is through
I will spend eternity with you
If you love me
Do you love me
Let it happen
Let it happen darling

No One Ever Sees Me,pop,Unisonic,2012,353,{},"Anna hurts herself to cover up
The deeper pain inside
And if you ask she's alright
But in the night she cries
Her father says: You better get your head right!
Cause if you don't, you'll lose the fight of life!
You'll find a man that will give you guidance
Who you can tell what you never shared with us
Do you ever think about us?
No one ever sees me!
No one ever hears me!
No one knows me
No one feels my pain
I fade away
Sati's dad is honoring
What always was tradition
He will choose who'll marry her
There must be no confusion!
And if she starts to babble 'bout love
I will forget what I am made of
I will end her life with my own hands
Do what it takes and what honor still demands
It ends right here

Four shining virgins weaving silk trees in the yard

To the sweetly bending sky

And I don't remember much
Two roaming architects are trudging through the leaves
In the branches of the trees they built a little house for me

And as I climb my way back home, maybe you'll think of me

Well, violence to me and Mustafa is taking you by your arm and chaining you to the bumper of my car and then chaining you to the bumper of his car and then we drive in opposite directions. That's violence. You ain't seeing a burst of it.

You want to be the Tag Team champions? We cost you the belts. Now we attacked you again, coming out to get it. And son, that's just the beginning. You're in for a long ride. You're in for a bumpy ride. You see the Gangstas ain't to be played with. We [have] been fined and we [have] been bahned in more organizations and federations than you can imagine. We are here for two reasons: To get paid and to beat the hell out of you.

You're perpetrating, boy. You are no original gangsters, you are original pranksters, you understand? I've been living in South Central all my life and not one time have I seen that Puerto Rican or not one time have I seen that punk Rock walking down the street of Crenshaw.

You understand of South Central? You want a little bit? Bring it on. Tonight we beat the daylights out of you and look what happened. If you was done with us, we would have been left in the ring. And if we were done with you, we would have been left in the ring. But son, we get up and came onto you again. Luckily enough you might have got the pin, but the battle has just begun. We're gonna drop it on you, boy. We're gonna bring you violence. ECW, you ain't ready for me and Mustafa. Public Enemy, you ain't ready for me and Mustafa.

I'm gonna let you know this, son. We're gonna put something on you and you will never handle like this. This ain't like nobody else.

Demon,rap,Tonedeff,2013,8119,{},"[Verse 1] Anxiety
Up in the morning I feel the immediate beat of my heart that is speeding up
Feeding a demon that’s seeking to eat at my being
I get up to pee and I think of a million things that I need to achieve
And the chi is depleting I’m sinking while dreaming of singing
I’m brushing my teeth, and I'm seeing the bleeding
My vigorous scrubbing is leaving the gums till they’re bloody and beaten
My stomach is screaming for something appealing to munch in the PM
But what I’ve been dealing with really been keeping my hunger receding
I want to proceed but I’m weak, and wiggin the fuck out I’m freaking
I’m stuck in a rut and the wheels of my brain have been peeling away in the deep of the mud
And I’m eager to rush to the people to bust on the beats in the club
But the meetings they come by the dozen, with none of em seeming to budge
(Jesus!) There’s nothing to for me to become
If I’m happy to sit on my ass and imagine my team had a buzz
And it's never been easy for us, and then seeing the fuss over green little fucks that the media trumps while they leave us to eat up the crumbs
(Egregious)

And little by little I’m chipping away at the brittle facade of my will
To fulfill the ambitions I had as a child
Anxiety riddled, when time is an issue - I’m bound
(You will not slow me down!)
I’m driven to finish the mission, no matter the prison I sit in
Is mental or physical, when did this shit go to trial?
Possessed by a negative sense of denial and doubt
GET OUT MY HEAD! O DEMON

[Verse 2] Trial
Ladies & Gentlemen, May I direct your attention to gaze on the evidence
That has been getting me fed up whenever presenting it
Let it be known to the jury and judge of the court that I’m seeking a settlement
And a conviction to put the defendant to death
And I meant it when I said my etiquette wasn't as elegant
When I'm addressing this Son of a bitch in my presence
I bet if I let you reflect on elements that have been set up ahead of the
Sentencing, you would agree with the sentiment - O, Demon
Look at the skeleton. People, now who could you tell it is?
Who do you know that could truly renew it to sediment, ruin the specimen
Who in the hell be as decadent,? Part of his nature - a testament
To be compelled to kill - whether he had the intent is irrelevant
Who is the addict of adding the panic, until you need medicine
Brutally batter executives, sicken the pitiful peasant
The funeral debt is tremendous, we'll get a confession! Or better yet -
2 to a cell - if it’s time and anxiety in bed together
This beautiful serial killer has managed to kill everyone on the
Planet 100% of the time, And his record is perfect
And I will admit that I kind of admire that sort of commitment
Denying the feat - you’re committing a crime with that bit of assertion-
I’m ripping the curtain, revealing the truth and they get to observe it
I’m beginning to see the effects and he’s getting so nervous
If our bodies regenerate why in the fuck do we celebrate
Dying a day at a time from the poison he' gave us when birth hit
And I’ve had it, no matter the verdict, I’m taking the law and I’m skirting it
Doing it dirty, I’m bringing the murderer down
If it’s sounding like I’m in a hurry, or cursing you out
(You will not slow me down!)
I want it so bad that I hate it, I’m breaking the barrier - racing
To win everything cause I made it personal vow
So either I die when I try or I throw in the towel
UGH! GET OUT MY HEAD! O' DEMON

[Bridge]
I don't wanna wake up. I don't wake up
I don't wanna wake up. Anymore
I feel it when I wake up, like I just exposed a nerve
Cannot shake the feeling - I left a single stone unturned
I feel it when I wake up, like I just exposed a nerve
Cannot shake the feeling - I left a single stone unturned

[Outro]
I know you're relentless, you’ll never stop coming to tear me to pieces
You hunting me, Crushing me, running me into the ground
Till I vanish when breaking the fucking speed of sound
You will not slow me down!
I know that I’m living on time that I borrowed
And maybe tomorrow’s the day that I finally take my applause and bow
I will not wake up in a panic again, starting now!

Except that they were not credible
They didn’t mention the making of bombs
Or how his farts were used to torture
Every single war was all a lie
Either way, everybody died
Except in the most painful way
Lil booty buns farts sharted away

But Lil Danny also has smelly farts
Sometimes during sleepovers
He’ll come over to you
And he’ll fart on you
It smells like rats and bittery bats
It’ll slowly kill you
Your nose will slowly disintegrate
And your body will fall apart

Lil Booty Buns and farts are very similar

Were actually Lil Boot Bun’s stinky farts

Yo lady luck’s a crazy fuck, I was sitting rubbing her tits
Corrupting her kids, sucking love from her wrist out the razor cuts
The bloodshed ain't done yet, mouths stay unfed
With all the funds let most my buds said they got no drugs left, on check
Yo fuck rent, see me sweating in December
My ex-roommate got a stack of death threats addressed to Bender (yo leave me a message)
While I hit snares on point breathing asbestos
So the fumes got anyone in the room feeling my presence
Now there's a, mushroom cloud cover shrouding Silver Falls
Too dumb and proud to wonder how this fucking town don’t kill us all
The filthy stalls with bugs within the walls and vixens licking salt
Off my itchy balls or just convulse until the pill dissolve
I've been involved in mixed assaults, it's business brawls where kids get sprawled
To the point you have to check a pulse and have the medics called (yeah)
Only quit the habit I got, if I'm getting nabbed by the cops
And the pigs still gotta constrict my fists with a padded lock
The aftershocks would last so long, my bones were bended in a slow progression
Clothes soaked and drenched in cobra venom
Violent nihilists with their minds fucked up on drugs
And all kinds of viruses light what they find stuck in the rug
Dirty junkie tryna search for money at the park
And if the search gets ugly I might merc' somebody after dark
And I'm starving spark, this beat is skipping in my heart
Never visualized how getting high could rip my mind apart
And I always chase, never pick syringe over foil
I inner boil while the dragon got me gripped in his coils
Waiting in this basement for four or five hours, thinking ""I just need the nectar from a fortified flower""
And my girl's been telling me it's over
All the time while I reply ""Go back and tell me when I’m sober""
Thought, soon enough that sort of dam’ll clear to drop
But for now I'm mixing Nyquil with my Jacks and sleep it off

Of my hand through your hair

You know I would pick you up and take you to bed
I would lay you down with a kiss
And we would spend the day without thinking ahead
But since I've been gone for so long
I can only lay with you inside of my head
And tell you everything I would do for you
When I get home to you
I'll touch you so that, just so you know that

Sipping shadows from the moon

It scratches the thin tin roof

Racing for the truth

And make me believe in

The flesh colored Christs
Who spoke and who light

Where are the borderlines?

There’s no reality

No sadness was kept

The Road Youre On,pop,Louis R. Bucalo,2016,67,"{""Jeremy Hays""}","Many roads that we travel on
Will hold more than first appears
Trouble lies near each path we take
And can make our way unclear
What can decide, be our journey's guide
When fate would interfere?

Think about the road you're on
Does it lead where you belong?
Will you find the truth on your way?
Never fear the road is long
Gather strength and carry on
And your heart you'll never betray
Think about the road

Some would walk only in the sun
Though they seek to travel far
Yet rain will fall on each one and all
Who would seek their guiding star
But no hand of fate holds a choice we make
That tells us who we are
Oh think about the road you're on
If it leads where you belong
You will find the truth on your way
Never was a danger born
That could change the right to wrong
What's in your heart don't ever betray
Think about your road

All the road that's behind you
Brought you where you stand
The courage gained from all the lessons learned
Is there at your command

Think about the road you're on
If it leads where you belong
Then let nothing stand in your way
Think about the road you're on
Does it lead where you belong?
Will you find the truth on your way?
Never fear the road is long

See I'm a big man, old like 40
You can't teach me, showerman taught me
This ain't a video, no it's not a movie
It's Street Crime, pull out the Uzi
I will catch a MC off duty
Man try act like he never knew me
That's not a diss, or subliminal
See I'm a badman, straight up criminal
If I get chiefed up, that will be a miracle
Sound like H and I'm so original
You must be smoking my friend it's like
Them man are smoking again it's like
I don't know none of them it's like
Swear I don't know none of them (what)
Let's get angry, let's get gully
Let's get paper, let's get money
Try diss H, that's not funny
Boy Better Know 'till a man say sorry
Gotta stay on point, can't waste time blazing a joint
You wanna play with H, I'll come through, spray up the place

And I've got no fear, gotta be a soldier can't shed a tear
That's how it is out here, gotta get paid and the streets don't care

[Verse 2]
No time to chill, no time to relax
On road gotta deal with the cats
I'm the guy that you know from the flats
Shoot MCs, and stand back
Why things have to be like that (what)?
H, why'd you MC like that?
Cuz move with that eediat chat
Shut your mouth, I can see you're a cat (like)
This ain't bashment, man's not a yardie
This ain't a dance, nah it's not a party
Hold tight the soldiers big up the army
Look at my garments, bare Armani
You must be hating my friend (it's like)
Them man are hating again (it's like)
How much you making my friend (it's like)
Nah you can't be my friend (it's like)
Too much artists not enough tunes
Too much gangsters not enough goons
In this game there ain't enough room
Manna move fast like Zing Zing Zoom
This ain't a cartoon (what)
Man will get merked in a room
Swear, I will merk up a goon
If man say a word of my tune

Young!

[Verse 1: Young Righteous]
Steinbeck with a mic check, Kubrick with a dope chick
A penny saved is a penny earned, do the same apply to these hundreds?
Eyeing my survival, with a right hand on the Bible
Won't swear to God, I never cared for odds, my fate too great for a pack of cards
Return the pride of Zion, spit brimstone and fire
Damnation to a lot of fakers, these last days peep Revelations
Saint John on a lonely beach with a mean tan, seen a lot of angels
Seen a lot of demons, seen a lot of hell
Hopefully there's reparations, for a young sinner like me
For a young sinner like me...
See now I rap for the hell of it, cause Bank$y got the team, one

[Bridge: AJ Bank$y]
(Colossians 1:20-22 being recited in the background)
And I ain't even tryna preach to y'all but...
These the things that be on my mind, you know
Can I vent to y'all though?
This is just me
[Verse 2: AJ Bank$y]
Purposeful passion, I'm fiendin' things everlasting
Why Father Time never loved me, I'm used to being a bastard
Don't say you love me and hurt me, swear you ride and desert me
I'm keepin' it introspective, my spirit can reimburse me
Ascending up from the gravel, learning to pick my battles
I'm yearning for something different and disregarding my status
Oh Lord... Because jealousy's a sin
And I been envious forever, think it's time I should repent
Wasted hours on my conscience I won't ever get 'em back
Wasted nights and early mornings, had the nerve to take a nap
Wasted moments on the Net and then I pray to pass a test
Failed so many times before but even now I know I'm blessed
Holy Jesus, holy holy like it's Mensa at his best
Put the Burb up on my shoulders now I'm bending from the stress
Cause I know that we could make it, but my grades be looking shoddy
Should I study every night or pick a beat and catch a body
Brother tells me to focus, my balance intoxicated
Music is all I have, the rest of me feelin' jaded
Still doing it for the fans, Jhaé tells me that I'm her favorite... I know
And from the ashes know a flower could grow
I'm growing daily, a marathon what we racing
Them sprinters is getting tired, I'm starving patiently waitin'
Posses the heart of a lion, no lying, I wouldn't fake it
Throne be looking so vacant, a sin if I didn't take it
Amen
[Verse 3: Young Righteous & AJ Bank$y]

[Young Righteous]
Uhh, I'm Pericles to these rappers, y'all orators lack passion
No impediment but these weighted words treat Palm Bay like Athens
No democracy, pay homage, y'all wordplay straight garbage
My metaphors like Michael Kors, I'm even liked by yo momma, ha

[AJ Bank$y]
My odyssey sparked non-belief but I made it home to my safe zone
Peace, love and some solitude, that politicin' bring gravestones
All we had was a mustard seed so I planted that and my faith grown
Found refuge in these parables, the only way that I stayed strong

[Young Righteous]
Y'all dislike our rhetoric cause y'all ain't hip like Taylor Swift
But I digress just to address this ignorance that still persists
Are my adverbs so adverse, am I less dope cause I don't curse?
Giving y'all that blunt truth, better smoke that 'til y'all lungs hurt

[AJ Bank$y]
Take a deep breath 'til my lungs work, inhale then exhale
Then write lines 'til my thumbs hurt, spit flame 'til my tongue burnt
I meant spit rhymes like a gun burst, played roulette with my worst sins
Shed tears all on them church steps to the background of my first hymns
Guess that road keep getting smaller they say only few gon' find it
The mountain getting steeper doesn't mean that I won't climb it
I told y'all this was different, now this serves as a reminder

Them man are pleated skirts, they're easy to merk

Got the fire inside so I'm eager to burn
And I was ten when I knew I had a love for the music
From then, eager to learn
I need beats like Piggy head, needing a perm
I watched Shabba get buried by Ninja at Sting, from that I was on dis ting
And then I tuned into 9-4-5 where Shabba and Skibadee kept it live
Eksman was a lyrical dan on the mic
Hold the mic I don't pet I'm a lyrical architect

Got a tingle in my nose
Love is flowin' over me, from my head down to my toes
Everything makes me feel fine. Happy go lucky!
Totally high now you're mine Madly in love!
Now I feel like i am riding on a rainbow
Then I hitch a lift upon some passing cloud in the sky
You and me we've landed in heaven
Could it be I've counted to seven?
Don't wake me up, I'm livin' out my dream
Got a twinkle in my eye
Got a wide and wicked smile
Since you breezed into my life seems I'm floating all the time
Everything makes me feel fine. Happy go lucky!
Totally high now you're mine Madly in love!

Is this now really happening or am I only dreaming?

I know I must be fallin
I never felt so carefree. So carefree

Predicted I would fail
A given I'd excel
At PowerPoints and sell

The fact I got an L
Cuz only time prevailed
Even when I wished well
I tripped up and fell

I flow to no avail
I-I
Flow to no avail

[Verse 1]

Slippin' can't tell
If this crap is in hell
Shorter breaths I expell
No remorse ever helped
Getting me on two feet
Stumbling too quickly
For me to even see

Few things work for me
Including the act of MC-ing
Few peeps spoken to me
Aside Slim and Indy

Shit I got, was in deep
A lonеr, went indie

Morals, left quickly
Quarrеls, been seen

Had to avoid
All of the noise
Getting a voice
While I'm annoyed

Or I'm distraught
Wishing I'll stop
Shooting my shot
Yet I cannot

Ever at all
Giveth a song
Off of the top
While I'm top
Time to go prop
Spit a new bar
For a chill broad
They're telling me

Just to piss off
Everyone

Even though it's all love
It arose as all lust
Condone I can't give some
Return it, not show up

That's how many fold up
Lend a hand, I tried once
Now they got my digits
Not amputated, bitchin

Can't put a finger on it
It's why I think often

Flow to no avail

[Verse 2]

We're going to back
To early May
Where I can't crack
Head is an egg

Pea for a brain
Seen all the pain

All I have learned
Just to go paint

A singular verse
That I have made
Without a brush
Let alone ink

Tattooing what I do in
Pens spilt upon the newest
Attacks against your crew when
The whiteboard y'all be using
Marks you all a nuisance

Using just my canvas
As my shield from all these asshats

Ain't talking pricks as assets
I'm talking those who kiss ass
Bitchin, never do crap
You cats is pussy, that's that

Don't try to hit a pause
Cuz like Santa, got no claws
Can't scratch, not at all

Unless a turntable's
All that you got

No fabled shows
That's what I cop

And fuego ways
All that I prop

And yet I sit
Like I'm in shit
Wishing I'd quit
My woefulness
Hopeless when

Of the babylonian anthem
That's why i ride the riddim
To talk to the poor and the needy
Global masters are greedy
Let's build our own story
To reborn in a new day, well well well
We are sick of this mad vibe what’s happening is so wrong
To show them we won't give up we'll stay awake all night long
Stepping forward, in the streets
As peaceful soldiers facing their fists
We won't loose the fight cause we are looking for justice
Our weapons are made of love and peace
Don't let make us their tools to enter a civil war
The next generation doesn't have to go so far

While the people is fighting against the people
While the government pull their string to enslave us
One day even the army and police will join us
Politics want the control, try to tame us

The bullet whirled sharply through the air
The metal projectilе embedded squarе

In his horror, Sheriff Crab was upset
Frying Pan Face took his turn
The failed attack was justly returned

Sheriff Crab died on that day
In a pool of blood undoubtedly slain

They were finally free from the annoying cop's pain

They all cheered, festivities were held
The town's nuisance was finally felled

Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party

I can feel it

[Verse 1]
A scar on her neck from where she slit her throat
And she smiled as she wept and she said a little joke
Now I got no time for you mystics and psychics
Different devices, gimmicks, and light tricks
Took a breath and held it deep
I'm looking for the man who is selling sleep
""Don't drift away"" she nodded and as if to say
Something that I couldn't quite articulate (I can feel it)
A colorful kaleidoscope behind the eyes, inside the soul
Where the winos line the roads amongst the undesirables
Reading bible quotes
The sky aglow with burning Styrofoam
The moon was full as usual (The moon was full as usual)
And I watched her as she slept (And I watched her as she slept)
Dreaming something beautiful (Dreaming something beautiful)
And I wonder what she dreamt (And I wonder what she dreamt)

Hey mister, your picture's been shown in books
Kind of walk funny from the cloven hooves
Dealing in daydreams and stolen goods
Something's in the shadows where the old man stood
If fear is a disease and the spirit is free
Then all of religion is a pyramid scheme
Assuming that the man in the mirror is me
And not just the one who appears in my dreams

Assessment of the Syrian Government’s  Use of Chemical Weapons on August 21 2013,misc,United States Government,2013,574,{},"The United States Government assesses with high confidence that the Syrian government carried out a chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburbs on August 21, 2013. We further assess that the regime used a nerve agent in the attack. These all-source assessments are based on human, signals, and geospatial intelligence as well as a significant body of open source reporting. Our classified assessments have been shared with the U.S. Congress and key international partners. To protect sources and methods, we cannot publicly release all available intelligence – but what follows is an unclassified summary of the U.S. Intelligence Community’s analysis of what took place.

Syrian Government Use of Chemical Weapons on August 21

A large body of independent sources indicates that a chemical weapons attack took place in the Damascus suburbs on August 21. In addition to U.S. intelligence information, there are accounts from international and Syrian medical personnel; videos; witness accounts; thousands of social media reports from at least 12 different locations in the Damascus area; journalist accounts; and reports from highly credible nongovernmental organizations.

A preliminary U.S. government assessment determined that 1,429 people were killed in the chemical weapons attack, including at least 426 children, though this assessment will certainly evolve as we obtain more information.

We assess with high confidence that the Syrian government carried out the chemical weapons attack against opposition elements in the Damascus suburbs on August 21. We assess that the scenario in which the opposition executed the attack on August 21 is highly unlikely. The body of information used to make this assessment includes intelligence pertaining to the regime’s preparations for this attack and its means of delivery, multiple streams of intelligence about the attack itself and its effect, our post-attack observations, and the differences between the capabilities of the regime and the opposition. Our high confidence assessment is the strongest position that the U.S. Intelligence Community can take short of confirmation. We will continue to seek additional information to close gaps in our understanding of what took place.

Background:

The Syrian regime maintains a stockpile of numerous chemical agents, including mustard, sarin, and VX and has thousands of munitions that can be used to deliver chemical warfare agents.

Syrian President Bashar al-Asad is the ultimate decision maker for the chemical weapons program and members of the program are carefully vetted to ensure security and loyalty. The Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC) – which is subordinate to the Syrian Ministry of Defense – manages Syria’s chemical weapons program.

We assess with high confidence that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale against the opposition multiple times in the last year, including in the Damascus suburbs. This assessment is based on multiple streams of information including reporting of Syrian officials planning and executing chemical weapons attacks and laboratory analysis of physiological samples obtained from a number of individuals, which revealed exposure to sarin. We assess that the opposition has not used chemical weapons.

The Syrian regime has the types of munitions that we assess were used to carry out the attack on August 21, and has the ability to strike simultaneously in multiple locations. We have seen no indication that the opposition has carried out a large-scale, coordinated rocket and artillery attack like the one that occurred on August 21.

We assess that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons over the last year primarily to gain the upper hand or break a stalemate in areas where it has struggled to seize and hold strategically valuable territory. In this regard, we continue to judge that the Syrian regime views chemical weapons as one of many tools in its arsenal, including air power and ballistic missiles, which
they indiscriminately use against the opposition.
The Syrian regime has initiated an effort to rid the Damascus suburbs of opposition forces using the area as a base to stage attacks against regime targets in the capital. The regime has failed to clear dozens of Damascus neighborhoods of opposition elements, including neighborhoods targeted on August 21, despite employing nearly all of its conventional weapons systems. We assess that the regime’s frustration with its inability to secure large portions of Damascus may have contributed to its decision to use chemical weapons on August 21.

Preparation:

We have intelligence that leads us to assess that Syrian chemical weapons personnel – including personnel assessed to be associated with the SSRC – were preparing chemical munitions prior to the attack. In the three days prior to the attack, we collected streams of human, signals and geospatial intelligence that reveal regime activities that we assess were associated with preparations for a chemical weapons attack.

Syrian chemical weapons personnel were operating in the Damascus suburb of ‘Adra from Sunday, August 18 until early in the morning on Wednesday, August 21 near an area that the regime uses to mix chemical weapons, including sarin. On August 21, a Syrian regime element prepared for a chemical weapons attack in the Damascus area, including through the utilization of gas masks. Our intelligence sources in the Damascus area did not detect any indications in the days prior to the attack that opposition affiliates were planning to use chemical weapons.

The Attack:

Multiple streams of intelligence indicate that the regime executed a rocket and artillery attack against the Damascus suburbs in the early hours of August 21. Satellite detections corroborate that attacks from a regime-controlled area struck neighborhoods where the chemical attacks reportedly occurred – including Kafr Batna, Jawbar, ‘Ayn Tarma, Darayya, and Mu’addamiyah. This includes the detection of rocket launches from regime controlled territory early in the morning, approximately 90 minutes before the first report of a chemical attack appeared in social media. The lack of flight activity or missile launches also leads us to conclude that the regime used rockets in the attack.

Local social media reports of a chemical attack in the Damascus suburbs began at 2:30 a.m. local time on August 21. Within the next four hours there were thousands of social media reports on this attack from at least 12 different locations in the Damascus area. Multiple accounts described chemical-filled rockets impacting opposition-controlled areas.

Three hospitals in the Damascus area received approximately 3,600 patients displaying symptoms consistent with nerve agent exposure in less than three hours on the morning of August 21, according to a highly credible international humanitarian organization. The reported symptoms, and the epidemiological pattern of events – characterized by the massive influx of patients in a short period of time, the origin of the patients, and the contamination of medical and first aid workers – were consistent with mass exposure to a nerve agent. We also received reports from international and Syrian medical personnel on the ground.

We have identified one hundred videos attributed to the attack, many of which show large numbers of bodies exhibiting physical signs consistent with, but not unique to, nerve agent exposure. The reported symptoms of victims included unconsciousness, foaming from the nose and mouth, constricted pupils, rapid heartbeat, and difficulty breathing. Several of the videos show what appear to be numerous fatalities with no visible injuries, which is consistent with death from chemical weapons, and inconsistent with death from small-arms, high-explosive
munitions or blister agents. At least 12 locations are portrayed in the publicly available videos, and a sampling of those videos confirmed that some were shot at the general times and locations described in the footage.

We assess the Syrian opposition does not have the capability to fabricate all of the videos, physical symptoms verified by medical personnel and NGOs, and other information associated with this chemical attack.

We have a body of information, including past Syrian practice, that leads us to conclude that regime officials were witting of and directed the attack on August 21. We intercepted communications involving a senior official intimately familiar with the offensive who confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime on August 21 and was concerned with the U.N. inspectors obtaining evidence. On the afternoon of August 21, we have intelligence that Syrian chemical weapons personnel were directed to cease operations. At the same time, the regime
intensified the artillery barrage targeting many of the neighborhoods where chemical attacks occurred. In the 24 hour period after the attack, we detected indications of artillery and rocket fire at a rate approximately four times higher than the ten preceding days. We continued to see indications of sustained shelling in the neighborhoods up until the morning of August 26.

To conclude, there is a substantial body of information that implicates the Syrian government’s responsibility in the chemical weapons attack that took place on August 21.As indicated, there is additional intelligence that remains classified because of sources and methods concerns that is being provided to Congress and international partners.",212402,en,en,en,

Growing up I didn’t really live the best life
You know I even had some doubts id never get a wife
I even had some thoughts of cutting with the knife
My daddy left me when in months I was two
I didn’t have everything I wanted I didn’t live life just like you
Then I saw it through
Some guy who married my mom who always showed me the view
The way life went and I knew it was true
True that mostly every night he’d come home drunk with the crew
Stopped and taken by the police , it was just a clue
A clue of why  you wouldn’t wanna step into my shoe
Verse 1:
The day he got out he vowed to us “I will change” is what he said
And ever since that day he kept the house over my head
Thinking we’d be outside n getting bread
But nah man we out there fighting the justice instead
My daddy was this close of being deported, and I just wanted to be dead
Without him I wouldn’t have a future ahead
He’s the one who fed and he’s the one who spent
Spent his cash just to keep us where we belong
He looked back and saw that what he did was wrong
He carried my family through both thick n thin, he is a hero with no cape that’s why he was always strong
N people always have the urge to ask
Like Emanuel how comes every time you walk through those doors you look so sad
Let me just tell you this , I never had the things that you had
I never had the things to make me happy that’s why I was never glad
Verse 2:
Until the day he came out of jail life was different with my step dad
The only reason I do this is to put my family high
People will tell you I’m not good that is just a lie
People always say I’m not worth it, but atleast I try
Always have a smile on my face like why?
Cause then I always feared of how I would die
Never leave me stuck or I’ll leave you out in the drought so dry

Don’t text me man I won’t reply
Always hated and doubted until you ran out, but don’t look at me man I’m not your supply

Middle of things, beautiful wife, word to that single kid

Don't try and size me up, line me up, no angles with
No slip, my hold on life is vice grip
Run a tight ship like aye aye captain
Sailor shades, close tailor made fly guy caption
This is life, this beyond my rapping
This is jogging for your jaw flapping
Summertime fall fashion, I'm cooler than most
I smoke to the roach, no joint passing
I'm passenger seat macking while my shorty slide past him

Been at it for a while, I ain't going nowhere

Guess you ain't shaked up the last
Heavy investors superceding my past

It's at night when they come,
When I'm alone, and not with anyone,
Through the shouts and music,
of the crowd down the road boozing,
Near the free car park,
The bins and the alleyway, of the Chinese restaurant,
Number 3 for 2, and number 4 for 1

[Chorus]
We're going down like BHS,
While the abled bodied vultures monitor and pick at us,
We're going down and it's no stress,
I lay and hope for the knuckle dragging exodus,
We're going down like BHS,
While the abled bodied vultures monitor and pick at us﻿,
We're going down and it's no stress,
We're going down like BHS

I think about the heat,
As it lowers it's self on me,
Past the closing hour,
When the light in my phone starts to lose power,
Through the karaoke it screams it's name,
You can't blame the betrayed,
In the snakes and ladders,
We are the Baldricks son, and Blackadders

We're going down like BHS,
While the abled bodied vultures monitor and pick at us,
We're going down and it's no stress,

We're going down and it's no stress,

(But ooh) Laying on a boat mate look at you,
(Ooh) Laying on a boat well what do you do,

Would you open your veins
Jump in the bathtub and plug up the drain

Elite nigga, all the street niggas feel his story
At peace with it, every piece in it shows my glory
I been weathering this storm, is the rain still falling?
Late bloomer in it, tell me is the game still calling?
But I’m chillin’, I don’t start no problems
Take them sparklers off my bottle
Way she use her head, like a college up in Oral Roberts
Told her I could swap her out some profit for a bit of knowledge
Trap be my alma mater, graduated dirty dollar
Dinner at the Posto, tell ‘em bring me my check please
Vertebrae sweats sit comfortably atop my SB’s
Everything proper, she wanna slob up my testes
I’ll be okay as long as niggas respect me

Just wanna thank you for the things you've amounted
Words can't express the love еven if I shouted
I know some pеople in my place that would give up though
But I can't give up since I'm your only hope
Don't worry momma I don't mind the pressure

I ain’t gonna stop till this comes to fruition
If I gotta my clothes for this to happen
So I can get my big brother out of fucking prison
And give back to the people I forget to mention
Cause I’ll admit the pressure sometimes gets to me
When I’m awake at night feeling so lonely
And I fall and theirs no one there to hold me
Cause who do I go to when I got nobody
How does a kid become a global inspiration
Cause I'm still the same kid who lacked the patience
Lost in a generation, full of people impatient

[Verse 1: Hakeem Shakur]

Hakeem is back with the lyricism
Annihilatin’ ABC rappers wit’ no rhythm

Primitive-minded muthafuckas on the microphone
Must I dislocate your jawbone?

You really think you got it made?
Well then step up, and I’ll run that fade

Because you’re weak; you’re primitive
You got no rhythm; I’ll thot-slap the melatonin out your system

For you to see you’re in the presence of a master
My mind is like Flash; it only moves faster
Smarter than the average man
Now tell me who can do it better? No one can

Understand? Hakeem only gets bolder
I’ll ignite yo’ ass, like a flamethrower

‘Cuz I’m one of the best from the West
And a muthafucka betta not try to test

Yeah; with every step I take I cause earthquakes
With every breath I take, I make the waves fluctuate

I’m a walkin’ natural disaster
Like an avalanche; step in my path, I’ll smash ya

Roadkill for you culture vultures
Until I take my AR-15 and poach ya

Open season on you perpetrators
Starin’ into the eyes of danger

You can run, but you can’t hide
‘Cuz Hakeem is steady scopin’ on the passenger side

For the first muthafucka who thinks I’m a joke
I’ll whoop yo’ ass so bad, I’ll leave ya cranium broke
What! Why you keep wussin’?
Either grow some nuts or keep it pushin’

Now you went out like a busta
Get a clue; Hakeem is the man, muthafucka!

[Break]

(On and on, to the break of dawn!)
It goes...(on and on, to the break of dawn!)

I thought I told you muthafuckas that I won’t stop
It goes...(on and on, to the break of dawn!)

[Verse 2: Hakeem Shakur]

Hey batter batter, hey batter batter, swing
Lemme step up to the plate so I can do my thing

Bringin’ a executionary style; so prolific
Now lemme take ya mind on a mystic

Voyage, light years away from vague
Doin’ way too much damage like the, Bubonic Plague

Your monstrosity (???) atrocities
Like a horsepower engine, ain’t no stoppin’ me
So buckle up your seat belt; hold on tight
‘Cuz I’ma take flight at light speed

All you dark forces, I dismiss your existence
‘Cuz I have no tolerance for belligerence

Walking in the midst of confusion
With mental cuts, scrapes, abrasions and contusions

Casualties; that’s my normality
As I diminish your falsified reality

Perversion and sickness overtakes the land
But with the mic in my hand

You should all know that’s a no-no
I’ll break you muthafuckas down with a lyrical fo’ fo’!

And if I catch you on the street, I’ll smack ya
Matter fact, castrate ya; now call me The Nutcracker

‘Cuz I don’t love you heathens
I’ll smite ya, wit’ my shank, ‘til I’m the last one breathin’

Yeah...
Yeah...it goes (on and on, to the break of dawn!)

It goes...(on and on, to the break of dawn!)

Debriefing my cohorts for the American Job, robbing for
The hood via cabooses, ransacking this financial establishment
That's as truly avaricious, Plutonian institution
Funding the F.R.S. (forever richest) misery painted green
By all the greediest and greatest of magicians
For ""Good artists copy, and great artists steal"" thieves artistic
At their craft of monetary trapeze acts, pick-pocketing
Wallets and purses, wire tapped, bank accounts of clients
Owned by the I.R.S.'s invisible hand, can't be bite
Monetarily we don't owe them shit, would if we could
Serve them, cotton paper at any moment anyways
To be eatin', when they really should be named ""U.O.U.S.""
Constituents misplacing their interests of trust
In allocated trust funds was never theirs to begin with
Sign that as the stamped notes of the Treasury
Borrowing from their booties, basically call us piracy
Modern day Blackbeards stealing back out of the Whitebeards
Walking the line with my crew, blue collar like Johnny Cash
We do everyday, looking like your everyday commonwealth
Perfect coverup for common career criminals, miscreants
Such as the six shooter Billy, you other mitches is Bonnie
Showing those mischievous who feed like beasts, 'til they get fat
Bellies and bleed by breaking their bloodbanks, +B Type burglary
After manhandling the Eagle, I bust the burgundy, blanco & blue
Out of their sacks (blood, semen and bruises) unlocking the safe
Combination, withdrawing the locks, entering the code
Lowering their guarded security, pulling the pin of my ""3-5-7""
Spinning the chambers', so the revolving lever triggers
The blast doors open, in these barreled, steel corridors
Of titanium built infrastructures, for my team is exemplary
And I am their bandana-disguised head honcho, Clyde Collins

I tried to write it down but I knew all along

There were no real notes or lyrics in my dream

Only the echo of a universal theme

What does it mean?

Somehow I know the perfect song is about love

What else is closer to perfection in this life?

Not like a Friday party Sunday sing-a-long

More like an early bedtime lonesome Tuesday song

Just the other day I was addicted to the ordinary

Just the other day all my emotion was imaginary
Just the other day

Then the perfect song washed through me

Filled my heart with tragic beauty

Now I hear the perfect song in everything

Sometimes a hint of music plays inside my head

I think I know just what it is but then instead

I realize it's not a song I've ever known

But it's a perfect start to what will be my own

Perfect alone

But the perfection loses focus as I write

And my most passionate reflections come off trite

Even a melody that makes me swoon and sway

Lingers a moment then the feeling fades away
I love you more than I can ever express

In anything but the perfect song

That's why it breaks my heart to tell it to you

In anything but the perfect song

Anything, anything, anything

I would do anything

For you",881891,en,en,en,4Vl0bnTSZtdVEDNdnXQ3OK

How many dead, enough to impress
So you were then, didn't step aside
When help arrived, you parasite
Left for dead now, you smell the glory
Never seen that much blood, for your fishermanstory?

Why do only stories that are sad
Keep the attention high, and others are denied
A missing link in life
A dark basement in our mind

It's like you lose it immediately if you go into a creative space with a business intention. You lost
You can still succeed with the business intention and make a product that succeeds, but the art value is gone immediately
And it's like, to check your intentions going into the album, and bring what you learnt from all your other shit to it, that's when the records come out different in my experience

[Verse 2: Stogie T]
Tom Ford stilettos
Charles De Gaulle airport
Ma, swear she a centrefold
Buying like she export
In the lounge drinking French port
But that’s my heart, y’all get extorted by weird hoes
Bunch of cornballs hiding behind scarecrows
Yours for the streets, mine thinks of me when she heads home
Gucci for the kids, they treat this shit like Pep clothes
Zoocci with the strings, give life to the kid Geppetto
Cognac Visetos, brunch at Trocadéro
Stuff so many muscles feel like Brock Lesnar
I’m no wrestler, I'm restless
I throw bets on potential
Can’t only measure success by low benches
My sense, the process shows best where you go next
Focus on no man, hold self to the code set, no less
Nothing's finished unless you started, that's old gems
Pour some Chris’ for my dearly departed old man
I'm still me in a Mazda 3
You still shrink in your mama's Jeep
You get fees, the master's me
You Toby, I'm Master P
That New Orleanian typa breed
My psyche need balance
High key Maria Callas
The shanties leave us callous, beer weed addicts
Hit the lick, pack the demons with us to the palace
And all you get is rich niggas drippin' with the baggage
I promise!
I could write a bible verse and still get a Thomas
Haters burn idols don’t follow no commandments
Only one God but these kids breaking tablets
You really on drugs, used to be they would bag it
Made French bread when you was still calling it ""Baguette""
Pin bae legs on the wall Miles Morales
Savage!
On my Fred Hampton, RIP Chadwick

Cupid to wound my love, which he denied,
And swore he could not for she wanted heat
And would not love, as he full oft had tried.
Jove in a rage, impatient this to hear,
Replied with threats; ""I'll make you to obey!""
Whereat the boy did fly away for fear
To Licia's eyes, where safe intrenched he lay.
Then Jove he scorned, and dared him to his face,
For now more safe than in the heavens he dwelled,
Nor could Jove's wrath do wrong to such a place
Where grace and honour have their kingdom held.

Everybody round me got it
Both pockets, they knotted
I had to go out and get it
Got the bag, no handouts
Hit the stage, I'm lit
Gotcha hoe bout to pass out.//
Swear I was grinding for this, perfect timing for this shit
Waited a long time for this lick, now the whole squad getting rich
Foreign whips, been doing that
I’m on another level
Haters looking from the nose bleeds
Tryna keep an eye on me.//
I ain't tripping, I ain't tripping
Shawty thick, I’ll tip her
If she bad, I'll hit it
Bout money, I'm wit it
I'm just getting to the bag
Got these lil niggas mad
I'm just getting to the bag
Got these lil niggas mad.//

Was it something that I said?
Did I curse the sky too many times
That it just cried again?

The wind is shifting eastward
And my mind is shifting west
And the birds are leaving early
Just to get out of their nests

And my pride is gone today
Was it something that I did?
My self control is in a blur
And I can't get over it

The grass is painted dirty
And my jeans are faded blue
The sky is looking down on me
And it's looking up at you

One more rainy day
And this town is gonna flood
It's the middle of December
And I think I've had enough
I complain about the weather
Way too much

But if I'm cursing what I can't control
I'll curse at your love

The sun is gone today
Did I give it a reason to hide?
Did my insecure and hurtful words
Drive it back into the night?

Maybe it'd come back someday
Now that the cold is here
But the ground is frozen solid
And these bad thoughts persevere

And my mind is gone today
Did I lose it or let it go?
Did I leave it in the closet
Or under all my clothes?

Is it hiding under my bed
Or did it turn into a ghost?
I wish that it'd retain some tame
But for now I just don't know
One more darker day
And this town will turn pitch black
I just can't stand these darker days
They're making me go mad

I complain about the weather
Way too much

I spit rapid fire, and I don't misfire
A lyrical high wire, hotter than a blow dryer

My career will catapult, and it ain't my fault
I'm too hard to swalla, and too big to over look

Exodus 18,misc,ESV Bible,2017,6,{},"Jethro's Advice

1 Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, how the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt.
2 Now Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, had taken Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her home,
3 along with her two sons. The name of the one was Gershom (for he said, “I have been a sojourner[a] in a foreign land”),
4 and the name of the other, Eliezer (for he said, “The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh”).
5 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was encamped at the mountain of God.
6 And when he sent word to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her,”
7 Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. And they asked each other of their welfare and went into the tent.
8 Then Moses told his father-in-law all that the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardship that had come upon them in the way, and how the Lord had delivered them.
9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the good that the Lord had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.

10 Jethro said, “Blessed be the Lord, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh and has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
11 Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods, because in this affair they dealt arrogantly with the people.”
12 And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God; and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.

13 The next day Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from morning till evening.
14 When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, “What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning till evening?”
15 And Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God;
16 when they have a dispute, they come to me and I decide between one person and another, and I make them know the statutes of God and his laws.”
17 Moses' father-in-law said to him, “What you are doing is not good. 18 You and the people with you will certainly wear yourselves out, for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to do it alone.
19 Now obey my voice; I will give you advice, and God be with you! You shall represent the people before God and bring their cases to God,
20 and you shall warn them about the statutes and the laws, and make them know the way in which they must walk and what they must do.
21 Moreover, look for able men from all the people, men who fear God, who are trustworthy and hate a bribe, and place such men over the people as chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. 22 And let them judge the people at all times. Every great matter they shall bring to you, but any small matter they shall decide themselves. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you.
23 If you do this, God will direct you, you will be able to endure, and all this people also will go to their place in peace.”
24 So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
25 Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people, chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. 26 And they judged the people at all times. Any hard case they brought to Moses, but any small matter they decided themselves.
27 Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went away to his own country.",3182554,en,en,en,

Night of the Hip N Dead,rap,Spork Kills,2011,15,{},"VERSE 1

When the night falls
And all the children's parents turn their lights off
A fog is building where the afterlife calls home
Where the white carved stones
Cover almost every inch of fine lawn grown
Half the people fast asleep and dreamin' all their nice thoughts
Alley cats are creepin', shriekin' awful night songs
It almost seems as if the teeny hints of life's gone
The secret is that anyone believin' this is quite wrong
Cause that's when the freaks come out
Seize the town and people scream and shout
When the peeps six feet deep leave the ground
To leap around the street to the beats and sounds
There's nothing that'll keep 'em down
Or make 'em go back into the tomb and stay
Cause as long as the music plays then it moves the graves
That's what you call radioactive

CHORUS
Start tremblin'
Your heart rate descends and then
Your skin is leatherin'
Then you're dead again
That's when we begin to roam
And rock out from the catacomb

VERSE 2

All hell's breakin' loose
Tell satan to vamoose
We're celebratin' spooks
Elevatin' ghouls and the ghosts in white
Into the high rankin' socialites who control the night
We're supposed to frighten most just like them poltergeists
Little kiddies close their eyes, older guys are so surprised
When they see the folk's arisin' dudes stay stiller
Statuesque to have your legs like two great pillars
It's a new wave ""Thriller""
When the dance floor chants for the doomsday chiller
You might be sick but lou's way iller
While you're tryin' to write a hit, my group makes killers
Who's to say bein' dead's no fun

I guess no one, spooks can play too
But they get no sun when the red glow comes
The cemetary empties like techno clubs

There's no get away

Yeah, straight A's bitch

[Verse 1: Ernie]
I've been getting Straight A's
What you trying to say?
Packing up my book bag, graduated in may
Trying to get a good job, I'll be stacking my pay
Gonna be the next rapper out the bay
But wait, I'm not even from there I'm losing my mind
A white nerd spitting bars, dude I'm one of a kind
Record labels hit me up and they want me to sign
Like right here, name and date on the dotted line
But I'm good
I'm independently repping my hood, trying to make it big
All my homies knew I could
Class makes their mind well, we're quite the opposite
Until my CD hit the stores and they was coppin it
And now that I'm on top of it, they show me respect
Cause everyone in the game knows that I'm up next
I don't even got flex cause they know I stay true
Plus you don't want to mess with my crew
[Hook: Ernie] x2
Getting Straight A's like every single day
Graduated last may from UCLA
Bachelor's Degree
A 4 point O
Now I can't get a job anywhere that I go
Thats why I turned to rappin I had to make somethin happen
The world chewed me up and spit me out into a napkin
That's how it goes when you live like me
Oh well, at least I still have a degree
Paper

[Verse 2: Ernie]
I couldn't get a job so I made one of my own
Now I'm making money and I paid off all my loans
I didn't think it could happen but I worked really hard
Started off by mowing all my neighbors yards
Every single dollar that I made was spent up in the studio
Now I'm really balling like my name is Ricky Rubio
Getting with these cuties though
Every girl I'm with gotta have a big booty bro
And it ain't a thang these girls hang on my chain like orangutan's
See I changed the game but I remained the same
I'm the best in the west trying to claim my name
I'm untamed!
Matter of fact I've gone wild!
Throwing temper tantrums like I did as a child!
Steppin at me?
Well, you better fix your style
Cause my rhymes are so hot and yours are just mild

The wind was cold
I stood on the bridge
As the river rolled
Thought of my troubles
I wanted to leap
I seemed to hear
A voice from the deep, telling me

No more tomorrows of loneliness
No more tomorrows in my caress
Come to me
And there'll be
No more tomorrows of loneliness

Sorry my baby
Where could she be?
I wondered if
She'd cry over me
Started my heartaches
My fire went flame
I seemed to hear
That voice once again, telling me
No more tomorrows of loneliness
No more tomorrows in my caress
Come to me
And there'll be
No more tomorrows of loneliness

So high was the tide
So refreshing
Right here by my side
It was my baby
Her arms open wide
She had returned

How New Technology Can Save Your Life in a Car,misc,NEW TECHNOLOGY,2021,10,{},"Park Assist and driver’s assist is a new technology in newer vehicles. This is a system that monitors your vehicle and determines if you are parked in the proper location to allow for a safe stop. This reduces your risk of a car accident and extends the time it will take to bring your vehicle to a stop. The car uses sensors around the car to detect a parking spot. The driver’s assist helps support the driver and does not take over control of the wheel. There are sensors to detect driver’s error and can respond to them immediately to promote safety.

Think of this device as your own traffic light. If you enter an intersection, the turn signal will alert the device and cause it to turn on. If you don't and you drive into the intersection, it will turn off. Of course, it all depends on which vehicle you are driving. The concept works the same way for stopping and going. You want to make sure you always have it on so that you always have the most safety standards.

Some manufacturers are quick to adopt new technology like Park Assist. Ford introduced it in the spring of 2021. In fact, Ford is one of the first manufacturers to include it in new vehicles. Toyota followed suit a few months later.

Don't expect this technology to be available with every vehicle on the market though. It will take some time for it to trickle down to all models. Right now it is only available on some Ford vehicles. There may be more programs available in the coming months. It is also expected that more manufacturers will offer it to consumers.

One benefit of this technology is that you can use it whether you are driving or not. For example, you could use it when you aren't using your vehicle to avoid excessive heat damage. The GPS feature tells you where the nearest gas stations are located. This allows you to fill up, pay, and then drive to your destination without having to use your cell phone or any other device that may drain your battery.

This is a great feature for those who want to travel by themselves. You won't have to stop in a gas station to use your pump. If you don't feel safe driving alone, it is much better to have this device in your car. It also means that you don't have to rely on someone else's directions. Now you will always know where you're going.

Some consumers have mixed feelings about this new technology. Park assist assists people to park in very tight spaces. This helps reduce dings and scratches with people parking too closely and opening the doors.

No matter what your views on this new technology in newer vehicles, it sure does make life a lot easier. If you are a daily commuter and spend a lot of time in your car, having park aid in your car could mean the difference between you arriving safely at your destination and arriving late at work. So, if you aren't a morning person, start using park aid today and look forward to making your daily commute a lot more pleasant.

When you drive a car, it helps to keep your eyes on the road. It can be easy to become distracted by other cars or wildlife if you spend a lot of time in your vehicle during the day. That's because the technology monitors the temperature inside your car. When you place your hands on the wheel, you'll have to stop your car several times to take your eyes off the screen. However, once this new technology is implemented in more vehicles, you won't have to stop the car to access the information displayed on the screen. You'll just glance briefly at the information, and then continue driving. In the more luxurious cars, there is a button you can push which puts the car into “self mode” driving. Some people who are on the road a lot and often in traffic can benefit from this feature, because the car will then be driving itself.

In a luxury car like the Mercedes Benz, there is a driver assist package that maintains a safe distance from the car in front of you, and can also stop the car completely for you. In traffic it can maintain a stop and go type of driving as well.

Check with your auto warranty  to make sure features like these are covered in their warranty policies. Sometimes, consumers want the bells and whistles of a newer luxury car but are afraid of the repair and maintenance costs. But, typically an auto warranty  will protect against mechanical breakdowns and even things like newer technology. Just be sure to check with your provider because manufacturer warranties expire. So you should also consider an extended car warranty from olive.com as well.
This new technology isn't something that most people are aware of. However, once you see how well it works, you may be eager to use it. If you have questions about park aid devices, you can visit the Park Aid website. There, you can learn more about the features and benefits of this product.",7150926,en,en,en,

Saying “seek and you’ll be led”

Bahram The Hunter,misc,Robert Laurence Binyon,2013,4,{},"When Bahram rode to the chase,
Then saw ye his soul's delight
Full on his kingly face.
Who could his steed outpace?
He swooped like a falcon's flight;
Like a sunbeam that strikes from a cloud,
Exulting and eager--browed,
So rode he his reckless race.

Bright flashed the pools at morn,
And the sun o'er the mountains burned
And gilded the antelope's horn
In the plain, and the wild ass in scorn
Of the hunter the hard soil spurned,
Snuffing the wind, most fleet
Of quarries, the beat of whose feet
Is music to kings' ears borne.

Bahram smiled as he rode
On the gold--bright sands; debonair
Was his look, and his glad voice flowed.
White was the horse he bestrode,
And over his black beard and hair
The white--furred cap on his head
Was hung with tassels of red:
On his mantle a gold sun glowed.
And round him glittering gay
Rode princes and lords; he turned
To each with a word to say
In his royal courtesy; nay,
Not a heart but joyously burned
To be near to a heart so great,
And was fain to be proved its mate
In a glorious deed this day.

But the king's men shouted; for lo!
The wild ass afar they espied
In the shallowing valley below,
Where bright springs fathomless flow.
He was shaking his neck in pride,
And his heels the dust upthrew:
Then Bahram shot forth to pursue,
As a bolt that is shot from a bow.

The princes of Persia spurred,
But he left them all; this day
There was neither second nor third
To the king. Now a startled bird
From the low thicket fluttered away;
Then the plain smoked up in a cloud
Behind them, and thundered aloud;
Yet never the king they neared.
Swifter the wild ass fled,
But swifter the king came nigher,
Wherever those fleet heels led;
Now soft upon mosses he sped,
Now the hoofs upon stone struck fire;
Till the wild ass turned in his fear
For an instant, and showed him clear
The eyeball strained in his head.

Then the princes shouted as one,
For they heard the king's glad shout,
And saw his spear raised in the sun,
And the light o'er the long shaft run;
As they looked for the steel to flash out
On a sudden the place was bare;
Bahram was no more there,
And the wild ass galloped alone.

Pale they spurred o'er the ground,
Then reined in close with a cry,
Gazing in terror around:
Neither king nor horse they found.
But before them laughed to the sky
A pool of springs that well
From the streams under earth and swell
Through her secret caverns profound.
The women of Ctesiphon wail,
And the young men cry in the street,
``No more now in the Vale
Of Heroes shall Bahram hail
His quarry of glancing feet,
No more shall his voice delight
Our hearts through the battle, and smite
The ranks of the Tartar pale!''

The mother of Bahram hath made
Amid pillars his empty tomb
Of porphyry, jasper and jade.
Clear gums in fire she hath frayed
To cloud it in idle fume.
Not riches from isles of the dawn
Nor spices from far Damaun
Lure hither the strong--winged shade.

Tomb nor prison shall tame
Bahram the hunter's soul.
As of old to the chase he came,
He is turned not aside from his aim,
He is mixed with the streams that roll
Unending as man's desire,
That shall not abate of its fire
Till the whole world crumble in flame.",253187,en,en,en,

Come on, let’s have some fun

An instinct to act on

And now we know we must not hide

Their justice, corrupted
So ascend to torment
You’re the same… You’re the same
By blindly seeking honor
Your true nature comes out to play

Show no mercy to them all

Crisis — an opportunity for change

I saw boomers and millennials
In a neotenous glow

Of civilization at affordable prices
Easily accessible and customizable

Furnishing the symbiosis of the will-driven society

In another hemisphere
All I can do is sit and stare at your pretty,
Stare at your pretty face

We've been out every night
You're mine without a fight
Holding on to you is simple and new,
I'm dying for you

Living away from you is killing and bleeding
My lungs are receding

Something about you just makes me whole

Come down for a drink or two
And sit beside the window's view
Make room for the looks we'll share
As I focus on you
And you comb through your hair
I know that I'm not your choice
But the boy I was wasn't who you loved
And so I'm gonna sit outside
And think of you
Is that alright?

You cannot flee from love
Knicks and bruises are just trophy cups
I've got your scent embroidered, and stuck in my senses
Latched onto my front brain

Call me never; leave no voicemails
How can I be sure you're still around?
It's not addiction, I'm just affixed to you
And your open wounds

Living away from you is killing and bleeding
My lungs are receding

Something about you just quits me cold

Nicomachean Ethics Chap. 1.1,misc,Aristotle,2013,1455,{},"EVERY art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are activities, others are products apart from the activities that produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions, it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities. Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity — as bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall under yet others — in all of these the ends of the master arts are to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is for the sake of the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions, or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the sciences just mentioned.",242802,en,en,en,

Got to pay the rent or pay the speeding tickets
Lord, the unemployed felon been unemployed size 9/11
But his kids still want them nines and elevens
Last year foot grew to a size seven, now it’s full price
Nicotine fiend smokes two packs a night
Or two packs of white, it’s just true facts of life
First was Chris Paulin’, now he eight ballin’
House full of fiends, babies in the corner crawlin’
Moral of the story is darling
Water too high then don’t try to be a marlin
‘Cause the hare with the speed of Clinton Portis
Couldn’t even compare to the flare of the tortoise

L Train,pop,Chiara Civello,2015,70,{},"A quarter moon is shining high
In union square
A sense of expectation
Hanging in the air
I feel a change is coming
From somewhere deep inside
I walk into the station
And take you for a ride

L train
Love train
L train
Please take me to the end of the line

Rising into darkness
Deep below the ground
I feel somehow elated
By the screeching metal sound
And i look outside the window
At the world i leave behind
Hiding in the shadows
You gain speed in my mind

Love train

Please take me
Till the end of the line

I tell myself I'm finally
Ready to let you inside

I push your heart away
And tell you ""Please, oh please, don’t call""

Of all the times I've cut you off
And you've remained so perfectly true
But Monday rolls around, I think of me
Of all the times I’ve been so hurt
And you might be just another [?] thief

I've been waiting, waiting
For someone like you
Been waiting, waiting
And you've been waiting, waiting
For me to see you
Been waiting, waiting
I'm taking my sweet time, I've said before
Even though I knew from our day one
You'd never take yours
I'm taking my sweet time, you know it's true
Cause I’m looking for forever
Not just another honeymoon

I’ve been waiting, waiting
For someone like you
Been waiting, waiting
You've been waiting, waiting
For me to see you
Been waiting, waiting
Oh, and I’ve been waiting, waiting
For a patient man like you
Been waiting, waiting

So everybody knows her in this town
If you were here you would've seen her around
Seen the boys that, that she broke down
But why the hell can I tell that she's so proud
I gotta admit I've given her a look or two
Because on the outside she just seems supercute
She be going 'round the town like a hula-hoop
Gotta solve the mystery just like Scooby Doo

Even if you miss what we had
Cause' you threw that shit

Won't break again
Too many times that you got me in my head like
Yeah you talk too much for your own good
See you try to better yourself, yeah you should
I know that you're not lonely
That's a thank god for me

Love One Another,pop,Michael W. Smith,1992,357,{},"I had a dream that I was speaking
With a prophet from the land of wise
In a crowd of people from the land of troubled hearts
I said, ""We've come here for answers
A solution to our world's demise""
He said the journey would be long
But here is where you start

Love one another
Love one another
Work it in to work it out
There can never be enough
Love one another
Love one another
'Cause you know without a doubt
You can change your world with love

It was a simple conclusion
But I thought that it was rather profound
Just a fundemental law that we should all live by
I took it in to tomorrow
Yeah, I walked the earth but I never found
Any corner of the world
Where this did not apply
Love one another
Love one another
Work it in to work it out
There can never be enough
Love one another
Love one another
'Cause you know without a doubt
You can change your world with love

And looking out I saw no method to the madness there
Like in a vision from the Isle of Patmos
I was scared
It was a revelation
Love is getting rare

The people of the land united
And in my dream, we all agreed
That we should start again
And this would be our creed...

Work it in to work it out

Was my own and back at me it stared
Said it's time to wake up
The coming days aren't a given
(Is that job what you're supposed to do?)

Then I woke on the stairs
With my [?]
Guess it's time to wake up
'Cause no one put us in prison

Time was on our side
But we were fooled
We lost the way
Way did we
Ignoring all the rules
The window closed
We didn't choose
Way did we

And the pain that's involved
To just working on living at all
And we hear in the [?]
Might not be able to listen
Pay the bills
Pay the rent
When that's over, what do you have left?
When your energy's gone
Sleep is one way to get it
(We'll take in another way)

[Instrumental]

Time is on our side
But we were fooled
We lost the way
Way did we
Ignoring all the rules
The window closed
We didn't choose
Way did we
Once I felt so strongly
Didn't get what I was saying
It mattered not
What they believed
Oh them the way
That I was measuring it all

Drew a face in the air
Was my own and back at me it stared
Said it's time to wake up
The coming days aren't a given
(Is that job what you're supposed to do?)
Got the scent of it all
Felt my back right up against the wall
When the feeling is gone
'Dreamin's one way to get it

Gives despair to millions of glances
Time is imprisoned in everyone
In everyone private dimension is hidden

To gain the long dreamt summit...

And put it to my head as my tears start to trickle

I get no support, I just have the worst luck

But I can't let none of this pull me from the hip
I just gotta get my grip and not lose it
Focus on the music, this pen is therapeutic
Let the lyrics I write motivate me, shape me
And one day save me, I know it's gonna make me

No more turning back cause right now, I need this

Of the ships on the bay
Had come to bore me through and through
But they suddenly seem new again
In that old familiar way

The delicate ballet of blossoms falling off a tree
Had long gone unnoticed by me
I'm stunned by what now I finally see
It's amazing the wonders you can find
Just by stepping outside

There's a skip in my step a divine state of joy
In everything I do
Cause I am feeling new again
In that old familiar way
When I'm awoken from my dreams
By a cuckoo on the roof
I always join in too
And every sound sounds new again
In that old familiar way

When I was busy always on the go
Left me with nothing to show
Now I feel that I can honestly say
I'm living a suitable life

There came a knight and played oer them a’.
Refrain: As the primrose spreads so sweetly

The eldest was baith tall and fair,
But the youngest was beyond compare.

The midmost had a graceful mien,
But the youngest lookd like beautie’s queen.

The knight bowd low to a’ the three,
But to the youngest he bent his knee.

The ladie turned her head aside,
The knight he woo’d her to be his bride.

The ladie blushd a rosy red,
And sayd, ‘Sir knight, I’m too young to wed.’

‘O ladie fair, give me your hand,
And I’ll make you ladie of a’ my land.’
‘Sir knight, ere ye my favor win,
You maun get consent frae a’ my kin.’

He’s got consent frae her parents dear,
And likewise frae her sisters fair.

He’s got consent frae her kin each one,
But forgot to spiek to her brother John.

Now, when the wedding day was come,
The knight would take his bonny bride home.

And many a lord and many a knight
Came to behold that ladie bright.

And there was nae man that did her see,
But wishd himself bridegroom to be.

Her father dear led her down the stair,
And her sisters twain they kissd her there.

Her mother dear led her thro the closs,
And her brother John set her on her horse.

She leand her oer the saddle-bow,
To give him a kiss ere she did go.
He has taen a knife, baith lang and sharp,
And stabbd that bonny bride to the heart.

She hadno ridden half thro the town,
Until her heart’s blude staind her gown.

‘Ride softly on,’ says the best young man,
‘For I think our bonny bride looks pale and wan.’

‘O lead me gently up yon hill,
And I’ll there sit down, and make my will.’

‘O what will you leave to your father dear?’
‘The silver-shod steed that brought me here.’

‘What will you leave to your mother dear?’
‘My velvet pall and my silken gear.’

‘What will you leave your sister Anne?’
‘My silken scarf and my gowden fan.’

at will you leave to your sister Grace?’
My bloody cloaths to wash and dress.’

‘What will you leave to your brother John?’
‘The gallows-tree to hang him on.’

That Time My Hair Fell Off,misc,Dalmo Mendona,2014,61,"{""Dalmo Mendonça""}","When I was a kid, I always loved the opportunity to be snarky. Looking back I understand my sarcasm to have been rote and formulaic, but at the time I thought delivering witty comebacks was a display of my how clever I was. ""Oh my, is it raining outside?"" an adult would ask. Without missing a beat, I'd punch back with, ""No, everybody just decided to spit on me today."" This, of course, I said with a smirk on my face and eyes longing for a response, which I usually got in the form of a quiet chuckle. Really, it was my socially acceptable way to be a rude son of a bitch when my young self was otherwise always very polite. I must have been eight or nine back then, at the peak of the nineties, right around the time boy bands were all the rage and so were their spiky hairdos with frosted tips.

Naturally, I too, decided to rock the frosted tips. My mom had just finished her hair stylist course, and she was eager to experiment on my almost-black hair. It was actually her idea to bleach some of my hair, and after much deliberation, I relented, secretly thinking it was a good idea. This was when my hair was no longer as long and straight as it once was. It had started to grow a little coarser, very thick, and I wore it short. It was the same hairstyle as half of my male classmates: spiked up and slightly oversaturated with hair gel. As I remember it, the bleaching didn't turn out very good, but I decided to own it, work it, and let it go quietly into oblivion with my next haircut. When my dad first saw it, he said something to the effect of, ""You can do what you want to it; it's your hair. But I believe only women dye their hair. And men should be men, and women should be women."" I was glad to see the blonde hair go when it did.

The other day I went grocery shopping by myself. It was Sunday night, and I had to get up early the next day for work, but I had just moved into my new apartment and I really wanted to buy some new stuff -- those things you plug into the wall to make the house smell really nice, and a soap dispenser to match my new bathroom, and an electric grill because I wanted to cook more at home. The move was pretty stressful, as moves are, and somewhere along the years I had become the kind of person that gets stress relief out of buying things. And shopping is such a lonely activity. So I called my sister. Talking to her on the phone is like jumping into a different world, one that only the two of us have ever lived in. We speak a language where every other syllable is an inside joke. Every other phoneme is reason to burst out in laughter. I suppose that when people see me on the phone with my sister, they must understand, too, that for the duration of that phone call I am not on planet Earth. We like to talk about our childhood. We have little competitions where we try to one-up each other on remembering ephemera from the time we spent growing up together. My sister and I like to time travel. She had to go do something, so we said goodbye. She's married now. And I went on to get my chicken nuggets and soap dispenser.

Back when I was nine, I showed my Grandma one of my notebooks. I was just learning cursive, experimenting with my handwriting, trying to get all the curves just right one day, being inventive with capital letters the next. I remember telling her about all the different ways I could write the letter N. I knew for a fact then that the letter N, by its very nature, was very versatile. It could be written in a myriad of ways -- I had seen so in different books, peeking at some classmates' notebooks, teasing out even the smallest inconsistencies in my teacher's handwriting on the board. But Grandma was none the wiser, so I credited the different styles of N scattered across my notebook to my own ingenuity. I could barely contain my pride as she turned from one page to the next.

Still glancing at the open notebook, she asked, ""Do you know what that means?"" I realized that I didn't know what it meant. What does it mean? I didn't know it had to mean something. I was just happy I could do it. But, as it turned out, I had stumbled upon something meaningful. What is this mystery of life that I have uncovered with my art? So eager I was that I just blurted out, ""What?"" She looked to me, like a physician to her patient, and explained. ""It means you have no sense of identity.""

Those words -- and that voice -- came to mind when called my roommate from the grocery store. ""Guess who will be helping me dye my hair tonight,"" I told her. I had thought about making a change, going platinum blonde for a while. I gave it some thought for a week. I definitely didn't want to deal with the hassle of dying my very dark, brown hair multiple times. So I picked up the one box in that aisle that promised to turn dark hair into very blonde in one application (""Born Blonde,"" it said) and put it in my cart between the soy candle and the soap dispenser. I read the instructions very carefully and decided to follow most steps exactly as they were written. My hair was a few fingers long, but it's the kind of hair that grows upwards on itself, so I didn't feel the need to split it up into four quadrants or to apply the mordant mixture with a brush. I just leathered it all in and let it sit for the maximum amount of time recommended on the box. I winked at myself in the mirror; the color looked good and I was about to find out whether blondes really do have more fun. I just needed to rinse out the hair dye.

I misread the instructions. Putting my expensive college education to good use, I put aside the bottle labeled ""3"" and only mixed together the containers labeled ""1"" and ""2."" My roommate even pointed out that there was a step missing after she saw the unopened bottle, but I blew her off since I was certain step 3 was only used in subsequent applications. To this day I blame it on the unintuitive two-column layout of the instruction sheet that my hair turned out canary yellow. I went to bed, woke up the next day, put some pomade on my yellow hair, and headed to work kinda proud. It was hella ugly, but I didn't dye my hair to blonde to be prettier. I did it to make a change. To stand out a little. To let people know I'm the kind of [super edgy] person who evolves inside and out. Right? Right. At least that's what I told everybody who asked me about it at work on Monday.

On Monday night I bought a different hair dye in a box from the grocery store. They were all out of Born Blonde (it must have been very popular). This one only claimed to work if your hair was already pretty blonde. I decided that yellow counted. After that was done, instructions followed meticulously, my hair looked more natural. Save for the pitch black eyebrows and beard on my face, you'd never know I was brunette. By wednesday night I had grown bored of the color since it wasn't quite what I had in mind, so I went and bought an actual bleaching agent in hopes of lightening my nutrient-starved mane some more. That brought it back to yellow. By Friday I was already wearing a hat. I had all but given up on being blonde. I wasn't having much fun.

But on Saturday I woke up with renewed hopes and went to the store one last time. The box said Platinum Blonde, and on the packaging there was this pale, skinny, smiling, blue-eyed, very blonde woman. My great grandma was black. I don't think we shared any moments of lucidity together; by the time I had grown old enough to remember anything, she had grown too old to remember much. I loved sitting by her side, listening to her rambling stories that I'm sure were half history and half fantasy. I'm told her mother was born in a slave plantation, but the slaves were freed before she came of age. I liked feeling the Sub-Saharan in my hair. It was a thick black jungle that curled on itself, opening ways for my visiting white fingers, but just barely. I thought of it stripped of its rich color. Then I thought of it straight, flat, bouncy, light. I thought of how ridiculous that would look. And that's what I wanted. I walked to the next aisle over from the color boxes and grabbed myself a hair relaxer.

By then I was a pro at this game. In record time, I mixed the right ingredients, leathered my hair with the caustic paste, and let it sit for an hour. I stepped out of the shower, wiped some steam off of the mirror, and saw the color I wanted all along. It was perfect! I showed my roommate and declared that my original vision had finally come to fruition. Ecstatic, we went out to celebrate, at dinner and watched a sad movie. It wasn't until Sunday morning that I realized that I had forgotten about the hair relaxer. It was really just an impulse buy, an afterthought, but I bought it nonetheless, and I figured I had to use it. Besides, my roommate had teased me for shopping from the African American hair section as a [seemingly] white boy, so here was my chance to stand up for my African heritage. I followed the instructions carefully -- I had learned my lesson by then --, except for the hair-parting rule. ""Avoid contact with scalp,"" it said, but leathered the mixture evenly as I had the other four times that week. The waiting time was twelve minutes for ""resistant"" hair. I figured five would be alright.

I finished applying the mixture, which strangely didn't sting at all. As I removed my gloves, I noticed a few strands of blonde hair on the plastic fingers. Confused, I scratched my head and looked down at the plastic gloves again. My roommate and I must have seen it at the same time -- a solid chunk of yellow hair the size of a silver dollar, covered in white paste, hanging loose from the gloves. We stared at each other, wide-eyed, and I slammed the bathroom door shut. I don't know when I started screaming, but by the time I turned on the shower and jumped under the cold water my throat was already dry and the pit of my stomach hurting. I pressed down on my hair to get rid of the relaxer product, and down came my hair with it. ""This is the worst mistake of my life!"" The more I worked my fingertips into my hair to remove the harsh leather, the less hair I felt. ""I'm fucking bald!"" At my feet was a shallow, foamy yellow layer of water. My fake blonde hair continued to fall on itself as it clogged the bathtub. ""Why did I do this!?"" I was losing my hair. It wasn't the hair I grew up with, the hair I lived with for so long, but it was my hair, my blonde hair. I bought it. When I had no more strength to shout, and no more tears to cry, and no more courage to feel my stubbly scalp, I turned off the shower. The towel claimed some more of the weakened blond strands. When I found a mirror, I assessed the damage.
There were still patches of relatively long hair left. Those survived, but just barely. Most of my head was covered with millimeter-long little hairs, at which length I presumed was the weakest point, where the rest broke off. On the hair that remained, I tried pulling a little, out of curiosity. Not surprisingly, it was easy to tear it out of my head, not at all painful. Each strand was like a nylon fishing line, stretchy, and after I stretched it far enough, it went, leaving only the millimeter closest to home. Not strong enough, the strands let go of their roots destined to end up on a towel, over my bed, on the floor, and clogging my bathtub.

""Did you get your hair cut?"" people asked that Monday. ""No, it fell off. Literally.""",455005,en,en,en,

Mama Shelter,rock,Heather Woods Broderick,2015,323,{},"My brother’s city crawling
Gonna stake his own
My mama shelter’s cross the country
Saying babes come on home
My father’s counting a fortune
More than he’s ever known
The eyes that blamed the distance of the ocean
Stopped saying honey come ah come on

The pressure lies within the pride that’s losing some
The time I spend on other lives becomes less fun
I thank the luck I’ve always had in starting up
But I got half a mind to movie away and give it up

Got some loving arms holding me tight
Some right that came from the wrong
Your smoking eyes put a worry in me
I’d like to see you feel at home
Got a letter from beautiful Sara
Saying she’s feeling awfully down
Moving around from place to place
Chin up while she’s saving face
But I don’t like the thought of her walking around the city crying
The pressure lies within the pride that’s losing some
The time I spend on other lives becomes less fun
I thank the luck I’ve always had starting up
But I got half a mind to move away and  give it up",2214992,en,en,en,7a8xFiO2Kd4tRWLkz9v5YW

Smearing their eyes on the crazy Kali goddess

Strange music boxes sadly tinklin'

Frequently Wrong but Never in Doubt,pop,Cheryl Wheeler,1993,277,{},"I remember when George used to come to our house
For a meeting of one of his clubs
He would often drive down
'Cause we lived close to town
Where the pulse of the big business was

He belonged to the yacht club, the truckers, the shriners
Though he had no boat and no rig
Still he'd eat roast beef dinners
And hob-nob with winners
And wait till he hit something big

But before he could get that big fish on the line
They let everyone in and ruined the Shrine
And he was easily riled and likely to shout
Frequently wrong but never in doubt

His friends called him skippy
But he had no family
Till my mother's folks took him in
Just a short blond and wavy
Boy from the navy
And he never left home again
How he married Agnes oh I'll never know
She was gracious and gentle
And she loved him so
And he was grand in her eyes
When they would go out
And frequently wrong but never in doubt

And I guess he had a big time
Sharing the secret symbol
With masters elect of the night
Down at the Boumi temple

Well I guess he was crazy
I think he was lonely
My mother was his best friend
He hollered and cried
The day that she died
And I rarely saw him again

And I guess I've forgotten since I was a kid
I don't know why we loved him I just know we did
And he was easily riled, likely to shout
Frequently wrong but never in doubt",1367493,en,en,en,0FCqGRRwZwHXYlWF9HkgRw

A Bad Case of the Gimmies,rap,Dylan Owen,2009,57,"{""Chelsea Wertheim""}","[Verse: 1]
This is worn out imagery of torn down images
Crashing paper plane flights of sworn out sentences
In sorry songs that finish with a VIP pass to the ocean
Man I'll be making waves before I crash
What's the link between a smile and a cemetery?
Laugh tracks are with these flashbacks stacked in photograph packs
Or open album trash that leaks your empty memories
In worn down images of torn out tendencies
But I'll be back in New York soon where I can read this
To old bearded poets whose steam fled when fear hit their cigarettes and skin
They stopped pouring sunlight the morning they were born
They were only taught to run right
But isn't that me in the future? I've got a thousand of em
Caught in an instant. Chances where the sound is sung
You'll never drown me now when it's all about the listening
To the worn out admittance of the things that always get to me

[Chorus]
What if this ship was gonna sink in the next couple minutes
Would you drop the anchor from your grip?
Or would you go out fighting, singing Hallelujah on the bending bow edge of the ship?
Man what if your life was gonna end in the next couple minutes
Would you leave your sad soul within?
Or would you go down fighting, singing Hallelujah, with ""Titanic"" trapped in between your lips?
[Verse 2]
Yo and now I'm at a New York payphone with one call and a decision to make
I'd rather stay home than stay awake
Cause these days get worn out, these pages get torn down
Till snowflakes need to fall to warm grounds
But I've got a lot of sorting out to do. Don't we all?
Got a bad case of the gimmies and a stand like a bowling ball?
Well that's good, if you want belief to form around your beliefs
Otherwise it's a worn out streak
So I can either call my childhood and tell him it's my dream
Or join the cigarette men who all lost their steam.Is it a sentence or a savior when it's seen from the streets?
In worn out ways, I've got water at my feet
But even that can't stop me now. I've got a thousand of em
Tensions in my lungs and I swore I wouldn't count em
When there's not much more to believe in, you'll see it.In worn down days I'm torn but still repeating

[Chorus]
What if this ship was gonna sink in the next couple minutes
Would you drop the anchor from your grip?
Or would you go out fighting, singing Hallelujah on the bending bow edge of the ship?
What if your life was gonna end in the next couple minutes
Would you leave your sad soul within?
Or would you go out fighting, singing Hallelujah, with ""Titanic"" trapped in between your lips?",3417752,en,en,en,3OUkFRVJbUjV55bhD2wjtX

So sad and so abrupt

Hold on tight to every shred that still exists
Remember all the pain and all the passion
Fight on with your heart, head, and fists

Dance darkness of night up
Gods gave rise to a new war!

This was is not just a war
Today brothers kill each other!
Treason has reared itself a throne
Enemy poisoned our people's souls
By deceit and damnation...

Bloody glows brighten the night up
Echoes brought cry of dying men
We were looking and waiting
Ready to fight
Ready to inflict deadly blows!

Strange god brought treason
Poisinong hearts of many brave warriors!
Every day was bringing pain and disease
Dark clouds covered the sky
Wind brought smell of blood
Dark clouds covered moon up
Our hearts froze
We heard voices of death

Waiting for our day
We prepared sharp arrows and swords
Today Gods give us a sign :
We can take revenge now

Feeling cold touch of our swords
Enemy will learn what fear is
Let rivers of blood be our work

Strangers brought false faith
They turn against our native Gods
They will be damned forever
And their faith will burn with them in hell!

It is time to leave forest
Daybreak is coming
It is time to start a battle
Under a cover of mourning fog

I heard a voice talking to me :
Faithfulness is your honour
Songs of fire and steel
Never forget these words
""The wind came out of the cloud by night
And blew ashes about long ago
Shiny swords in the past
Are covered by rust now
And who remembers these olden days
Days of victory and glory
Or of disgrace and collapse
Who remembers... heroes
That died spilling their blood
To protect native faith and land
One can hear their voices today
They are still fighting
Sons of fire and steel...""",6512746,en,en,en,

And we invented the factory this time in history will change industry permanently
And us along with it

And though we might be a bit ashamed to admit it

Feels like we're staring down a gun and
Common sense says that we should turn around and run
But we're looking down the barrel focused on the brand of bullet
Trigger gets squeezed we might as well have been the one to pull it
Clocks ticking and when the end begins
Apathy will go down as a mortal sin

I’m starting to lose all my respect for niggers
Diss me online but not my face
I went to simply wholesome and got me a shake
Over 10 thousand hours kids that's what it takes
I’m really thinking about turning off my mobile
Hit the boulevard where they hop the lolos

Go against us boy that's a no no
You make me sick i still eat rizzoto
Fuck it do my thang, bbc my polo
Why you gotta be so materialistic
Niggas talking down cause they bitches is listening
I’m not the one you want to hate on young in
It's not really nothing To debate on younging
I’m the only one up here that can break a nigga
You are going to make me open up the safe my nigga
This is not really a close race my nigga
Lemert Park legends get it straight my nigga

I’m going to run the next millennium watch
I was there before the new millennium why
Now niggers going to be saying they feelin my style
I’m good on the lot I’m good on the block
They jokes ain't funny and the hood ain't broke
So everyone want to hit me with the legal approach
I’m going to come out so i stayed
You don't know what that means so let me explain
I was never scared of niggers that bang
I just never want to shoot but change

Ain't nobody badder they whisper on the radio

I’m scoring two 8 easy it's time to be up
All we gotta do is hit the bank and re up
And then go to another bank and re up
I want to apologize for shitting be up
If you hate that then bless your soul
I’m going to still be here ice cold for gold
Get my shit clean no i don't want to lean
You should have seen it coming but you don't want to be
Trying to be hard man niggers they be soft
But they don't want to be them selves man they want to act like God’s
I’m here to take what left my nigga
Yellow pole tools got to rest my nigga
Go and get a job at UPS my nigga
Get insures get you a ford
Find a board write your plans
Don’t respect me in your life again

Tainting the underlings with stories of oppression
Formulate notions about the others

Act III Scene 2 Shakespeare,rap,Saul Williams,2004,7960,"{""Zack de la Rocha""}","[Saul Williams]
This is a call out to all the youth in the ghettos, suburbs, villages, townships
To all the kids who download this song for free, by any means
To all the kids short on loot ,but high on dreams
To all the kids watching T.V. like, ""Yo, I wish that was me""
And all the kids pressing rewind on Let's Get Free, I hear you
To all the people within the sound of my voice

[Hook: Zack De La Rocha] + (Saul Williams)
Spit for the hated, the reviled, the unrefined
The no ones, the nobodies, the last in line (Shakespeare!)
Spit for the hated, the reviled, the unrefined
The no ones, the nobodies, the last in line

[Saul Williams]
I didn't vote for this state of affairs
My emotional state's got me prostrate, fearing my fears
In all reality I'm under prepared
Cause I'm ready for war, but not sure if I'm ready to care
And that's why I'm under prepared
Cause I'm ready to fight, but most fights got me fighting back tears
Cause the truth is really, I'm scared
Not scared of the truth, but just scared of the length you'll go to fight it
I tried to hold my tongue, son, I tried to bite it, not trying to start a riot or incite it
Cause Brutus is an honorable man
It's just coincidence that oil men would wage war on an oil rich land
And this one goes out to my man, taking cover in the trenches with a gun in his hand
Then gets home and no one flinches when he can't feed his fam
But Brutus is an honorable man
[Hook: Zack De La Rocha] + (Saul Williams)
Spit for the hated, the reviled, the unrefined
The no ones, the nobodies, the last in line (Shakespeare!)
Spit for the hated, the reviled, the unrefined
The no ones, the nobodies, the last in line

[Saul Williams]
If you have tears prepare to shed them now
For you share the guilt of blood spilt in accordance with the Dow Jones
Dow drops fresh crop skull and bones
A machete in the heady: Hutu, Tutsi, Leone
An Afghani in a shanty doodle dandy yank on!
An Iraqi in Gap khaki Coca Coma come on!
Be ye bishop or pawn, in the streets or the lawn
You should know that these example could go on and on
And what sense does it make to keep your ears to the street?
As long as oils in the soil, truth is never concrete
So we dare to represent those with the barest of feet
Cause the laws to which we're loyal keep the soil deplete
It's our job to not let history repeat

[Hook: Zack De La Rocha] + (Saul Williams)
Spit for the hated, the reviled, the unrefined
The no ones, the nobodies, the last in line (Shakespeare!)
Spit for the hated, the reviled, the unrefined

So here's the plan
The Ides of March are always at hand
And when the power hungry strike, they strike the poorest of man
And if you dare put up a fight, they'll come and fight for your land
And they'll call it liberation or salvation
A call to the youth!
Your freedom ain't so free, it's just loose
But the power of your voice could redirect every truth
Shift and shape the world you want and keep your fears in a noose
Let them dangle from a banner star spangled I'm willing and able
To lift my dreams up out of their cradle
Nurse and nurture my ideals 'til they're much more than a fable
I can be all I can be and do much more than I'm paid to
And I won't be a slave to what authorities say do
My desire is to live within a nation on fire
Where creative passions burn and raise the stakes ever higher
Where no person is addicted to some twisted supplier
Who promotes the sort of freedom sold to the highest buyer
We demand a truth naturally at one with the land
Not a plant that photosynthesizes bombs on demand
Or a search for any weapons we let fall from our hands
I got beats and a plan
I'm gonna do what I can
And what you do, is question everything they say do
Every goal ideal or value they keep pushing on you
If they ask you to believe it question whether it's true
If they ask you to achieve, is it for them or for you?
You're the one they're asking to go carry a gun
Warfare ain't humanitarian you're scaring me, son
Why not fight to feed the homeless, jobless, fight inflation?!
Why not fight for our own health care and our education?!
And instead, invest in that erasable lead
Cause their twisted propaganda can't erase all the dead
And the pile of corpses pyramid on top of our heads
Or nevermind, said the shotgun to the head",41465,en,en,en,5vPRX452ABQIbon7MVYYx5

Inside a chapel praying
My conscience I'll be saving

I rhyme and time flows, you wine and fine dine hoes
I know I missed you with this shit so just for instance
Trade me spots and tell me what's the difference
I made my mind up when I was twelve to never be what I was not
Pussy niggas just flop while I pull off in the drop top
Hitting pot-holes, cruising while the knock goes
Boom, getting hoes with all the goods just got clothes

You reach potential whippin' in that honda civic

Searching for a nigga's sanity, but I think I might've lost it
Until I find a new one, I think you better run,or end up a victim
My money on my mind, maybe you should get some
I see a lot hoes, I'm looking for a thick one
But all these chickens do is just cluck
To keep it honest yo I giveup
The world is falling and we're all stuck
But I dont give a fuck

I roam my mental 'til I find the shit I been through
Then burn it at the stake along with all the sentimental
Thought you were the shit but you breaking like fine china
Started with the dissing now you fucking missing like Harold Minor
Without the fame, I'm still a mile from lame
Which would kinda explain why you cuffin' your main dame
I'm straight, she initiated eye contact
Your girl is wack, I ain't worried bout your bitch like that
Nigga please, I'm worried bout my future and my g's
Dudes is funny with the money, they might shoot you over cheese
That's why you gotta be careful where you breeze , screaming' JESUS!
Fronting like you sick but there's nigga with bigger sneezes

Trying hard to please
And you hear the sound
That he used to love
Thru the rustlin' of the leaves

You losing him has taught you
That you wanted him to stay

I Love You Forever and Beyond Eternity,rock,Sun Kil Moon,2017,4240,{},"Came home from tour, it has been two months, I know
The summer is passing, I'm looking heavier, I know
Lay down on my bed I look down, my god my belly looks like Play-Doh
I'm almost fifty, I guess it's just the way life goes
Yesterday I got back into my better exercise routine
Laid off carbs, walked a few miles, I wanna be healthy and grow old
I wanna look good to you the way you look good to me
But I ain't twenty-five anymore, it's hard, it's just the way life goes
Turned on the TV and I saw on the news that in Japan a man stabbed to death nineteen people who were handicapped
My mind can't wrap itself around these things anymore, it's just the way life goes for some right down the fucking toilet bowl
I love my friends, P.S. friends the ones who love you back and most of all it's my family and you and your dog and your cat
Some have moved on and went down very different paths
I guess it's just the way it's just the way it's just the it's just the way life goes
Fog horns kept me up all night, you were beside me, I laid awake with jetlag and I tried to write
Talked on the phone to my foreign concert promoters, the cyclical way of life is a repetitive motor
When I'm fifty next year, I'm gonna try to pick my punches
Listen to my soul and try to trust my hunches
My body's telling me, that it's time to slow them
My creative calling will never stop going

Got me a house in the mountains and we rarely go
In this summer cause I'm always on the road
If I'm lucky at Christmas time we catch a glimpse to the Christmas snow
It's just the way life goes
It's the best part of the year, the glow of Christmas
The smell of turkey and stuff and watching movies and the candles flickering
I watch The Shining every Christmas religiously and A Christmas Story plays for twenty-four hours on TNT
Next year gonna try to spend some more time with you be the man I like to be and that's a better man to you
What's the year of (?) for once my garden out there in the mountains will stay alive
This point is about where I stopped the song a few weeks ago
Then I left for Buenos Aires, got a bad cough on the flight over
Now I'm laying in bed the hotel classical, got a decent nights sleep and tonight is my show

Gonna kill like I do every time, we're in this life once and when I arrive, Baby, I arrive
Gonna sing my songs and be back to you in a short time but I stop in New Orleans first, but I'm telling you, Baby, when I get home, we gonna be just fine
Sometimes when I'm alone in my thoughts, there is a war going on and my stomach is in knots
A lot of times on stuck on planes alone in my thoughts, wondering what the right thing is and what is not
Today I was alone in my thoughts, walked along the sidewalk, where this year Will Smith was shot
Will Smith the New Orleans saint, stupid, not the fucking actor, who were all times an inch away from playing a disaster
And of course I come back and I turn on the news
Look what happened up in Baton Rouge
The whole city is under the fucking waters as far as my cough and my travel was, gonna quit my bitchin'
Tonight I'm alone in my thoughts and at peace with myself, the choices I made and all the books and CDs on my shelf
Should have spent some hurts and sadness along the way
But I think of my friends, who have passed every single god damn day

And Caroline, your support and your love means so much to me
Every great man has a great woman behind him, who gives him strength and freedom to be the man, he is set out to be being

Ask me what it feel like
Staring at a sky so vanilla
Tellin' Kurt Russell
""Homie this ain't real life""
I'll be making good on my promises
Honesty is confidence
Lot of it is missing but I realize
I could be better than I was
Lighter on my feet
Cookin up this soul
When we fire up the beat
Light the fire underneath me
Higher when I speak
Like I'm climbing up a steep tree
Oooh come and greet me
After the show, after the lights, after the shine
After the hoes, half of them yours, half of em mine
Happen to find they grill me but I'm the chef you want
Once you get a little taste I'ma buy the restaurant
Sittin' at the top, synonym: upper echelon
Busy watching my life, stop, I can get you one
Haters are always hanging round like a crucifix

Sheesh not a bald man
Who here needs a hall pass?
I would rather kick it and do nothin' like a mall rat
Never Kel Mitchell but baby I swear I'm all that
Cuz I leap years every time you fall back
To where you came from, now where the hate go?
Oh you from wu-tang? Then why's your face ghost?
Bottle up my confidence and sell it by the case load
Take a bunch of optimists, and drop'em in the same boat
Ask them if that shits half full, half empty

Got a text saying, “Someone called the cops”
Right then and there I felt my heart stop
Cold sweats running all down my spine
Am I really 'bout to be doing time?

[Verse 1: DDay]
Knocks on my door, my ass is grass
Cement floors, got the stash in the trash
“Hello officer. Hey, hi, how ya doing?
I was just on my way, my garbage is smelling putrid, but
You are welcome to stay and have a look around
It's me and my two friends, man, we just hanging out”
Frozen in conversation I stared at his retinas
As they scanned up and down my bag, man, let me tell ya
A nod in my direction got me steppin', it's a standoff
No looking back, “You can have it,” like a handoff
But I kept going, and I kept quiet
Trash bag on my back, this shit, I don't like it
This is it, this is life, this is war
This is what it feels like on rock bottom floor
As three policemen walked out that door
Knees shaking, I can't take any more
Free to go, like a dream it's unbelievable
For real though, just two years and some weeks ago
My life flashed right before my eyes
And I'm supposed to tell you I'm a different guy?
[Hook: DDay]
But I act the same, still act insane
Same player, but I'm playing to a different game
And though I may walk through the valley where the Devils dance
I thank God for giving me a second chance

[Verse 2: Moses]
Backdrop: 12 o'clock, driving on a Friday Night
Meant to stay straight, don't know why that I took a right
Down South Main, brain dumb when I'm wicked drunk
Baker's dozen shots of Evan got my stomach numb
Bright blue and white lights flicking in my hindsight
Visions of me taking a trip to the clink a third time
Am I dreaming? Am I even alive?
The only thing I really see is every second of my life
Flashing in front of my eyes because of a DUI
And a rap sheet as long as the unemployment line
Alcohol in my blood, point three two one
Went from wearing cuff links to some handcuffs
Sleeping on a metal bed thinking my future is done
How I'll never get a job, how'd I let my brother down
How it's gonna be impossible to make my parents proud
Or I do the opposite and choose to turn my life around
Took three days until I could see the sunlight
Breathe fresh air for what feels like the first time
Seems like the whole world is a little different now
It's bright when you've been living under a dark cloud

Way too far this time
Threw a bottle and missed 'em
I wish I hit that fucker in the eye
I can't keep doing this daily
I'm gonna lose all of my bits
But somehow it's made me gather all of it

If life is pain then I guess
I'm doing a lot of living
And those who haven't a problem
They might as well be dead
Cause if you're not helping
You might as well be sliced off
Like Occam's razor

If happiness is tangible
It makes sense for them to be happy
But I've got my own materials
And I don't wanna hurt anyone
Cause everything is relative
The selfish can't exist without the selfless
And it's so frustrating that we can't create something, something new
If life is pain then I guess

The Men of No Mans Land,rock,Panzerfaust,2019,247,{},"Carry your cross, to the muddied step of Golgotha
Through the widening gyre; in the absence of everything
Carry your cross, to the muddied step of Golgotha
For a cause not known to the gods of our fathers
The earth did tremble, the skies did cry
It was our turn to play God
As we carried our cross


To Flanders, where the pipers played the song of Caber Fidh
To Flanders, in joyful march
To Flanders, here we were the men of no man's land
To Flandеrs, where war was changed forеver
To Somme, to Ypres, to Passchendaele
For a thousand days we wore the mark of Cain
We band our sorrow again
On the bloody fields of Flanders
We were the men of no man's land


Then came the gas; a harbinger of misfortune
Where all life did die, and by God the stench was infernal
Yet we carried our cross, to the muddied step of Golgotha
Where the earth did tremble, and the skies did cry
Yet we carried our cross through the muddied step of Golgotha
And like the birth of a pregnant insect
We went over the top

To Flanders, through the gaping shell-holes filled with decaying flesh
To Flanders, thrust in the barbed-wire
To Flanders, ""the worms crawled in, the worms crawled out.""
To Flanders, where these days will live in infamy
I prayed for that cliff to come
But it never came
(And) On the eleventh hour
Of the eleventh day
Of the eleventh month
The guns fell silent


""In Flanders fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row
That mark our place; and in the sky
The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below

We are the dead, short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow
Loved and were loved, and now we lie
In Flanders fields

Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
The torch; be yours to hold it high
If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields.""

Grows up again, to a storm

Months in the making and now I'm a rapper
I guess you could say that I'm adaptor
It started off like any other hobby
I put my mind to it and it made me jolly
But if I had to thank someone, it'd be Sonny
Mans had my back since the day that we met
I trust him with my life with no regret
He's the one that got me into the music scene
It all started from his single 18
He said that we'd be like Drake and 40
I told him that we wouldn't be that successful
But he's the one that unlocked my potential
And now I'm sitting here rapping on this drill beat
Praying that my boy gets a whole life complete

Just keep your head up, it's a long road with slippery slopes

Can't even find someone worth the ring
Maybe I try too hard, maybe I'm cling
But people these days want nothing but a fling
Maybe I'm just wasting my own time
Maybe I'm too caught up with making someone mine
Maybe I just haven't found the one yet
Maybe I'm waiting for the one to be met
Either way, it's time to focus on myself now
Long overdue but it's time to disallow any chance of heartbreak
I'm sick of heartache, I'm sick of how fake everybody is now
The only one that's kept it real is Mogul
No matter how I'm feeling, he's always hopeful
Taught me the difference between love and attention
Easy to confuse the two infatuation

Felt like anxiety was eating me from within
Kept falling down from the mistakes that I made
Wished the feeling of guilt would just fade
I didn't know why I felt so sorrow
Each day that went by, I'd wait for tomorrow
Had no goals, had no dreams
But I'm thankful that I met my boy Azeem
He's the one that patched the hole that I was in
Covered it up so I wouldn't fall back in
Had a long talk and I took his advice
If you don't love yourself, meet your demise
Been tryna practice self-love ever since
I'll admit, self-worth is hard to convince
But I'll do anything to learn to live happily
The friends that I got right now, that's family

Paradiso: Canto 8,misc,Dante Alighieri,1867,19,"{""Henry Wadsworth Longfellow""}","Paradiso: Canto VIII

The world used in its peril to believe
  That the fair Cypria delirious love
  Rayed out, in the third epicycle turning;

Wherefore not only unto her paid honour
  Of sacrifices and of votive cry
  The ancient nations in the ancient error,

But both Dione honoured they and Cupid,
  That as her mother, this one as her son,
  And said that he had sat in Dido's lap;

And they from her, whence I beginning take,
  Took the denomination of the star
  That woos the sun, now following, now in front.

I was not ware of our ascending to it;
  But of our being in it gave full faith
  My Lady whom I saw more beauteous grow.
And as within a flame a spark is seen,
  And as within a voice a voice discerned,
  When one is steadfast, and one comes and goes,

Within that light beheld I other lamps
  Move in a circle, speeding more and less,
  Methinks in measure of their inward vision.

From a cold cloud descended never winds,
  Or visible or not, so rapidly
  They would not laggard and impeded seem

To any one who had those lights divine
  Seen come towards us, leaving the gyration
  Begun at first in the high Seraphim.

And behind those that most in front appeared
  Sounded ""Osanna!"" so that never since
  To hear again was I without desire.

Then unto us more nearly one approached,
  And it alone began: ""We all are ready
  Unto thy pleasure, that thou joy in us.

We turn around with the celestial Princes,
  One gyre and one gyration and one thirst,
  To whom thou in the world of old didst say,
Ye who, intelligent, the third heaven are moving;
  And are so full of love, to pleasure thee
  A little quiet will not be less sweet.""

After these eyes of mine themselves had offered
  Unto my Lady reverently, and she
  Content and certain of herself had made them,

Back to the light they turned, which so great promise
  Made of itself, and ""Say, who art thou?"" was
  My voice, imprinted with a great affection.

O how and how much I beheld it grow
  With the new joy that superadded was
  Unto its joys, as soon as I had spoken!

Thus changed, it said to me: ""The world possessed me
  Short time below; and, if it had been more,
  Much evil will be which would not have been.

My gladness keepeth me concealed from thee,
  Which rayeth round about me, and doth hide me
  Like as a creature swathed in its own silk.

Much didst thou love me, and thou hadst good reason;
  For had I been below, I should have shown thee
  Somewhat beyond the foliage of my love.
That left-hand margin, which doth bathe itself
  In Rhone, when it is mingled with the Sorgue,
  Me for its lord awaited in due time,

And that horn of Ausonia, which is towned
  With Bari, with Gaeta and Catona,
  Whence Tronto and Verde in the sea disgorge.

Already flashed upon my brow the crown
  Of that dominion which the Danube waters
  After the German borders it abandons;

And beautiful Trinacria, that is murky
  'Twixt Pachino and Peloro, (on the gulf
  Which greatest scath from Eurus doth receive,)

Not through Typhoeus, but through nascent sulphur,
  Would have awaited her own monarchs still,
  Through me from Charles descended and from Rudolph,

If evil lordship, that exasperates ever
  The subject populations, had not moved
  Palermo to the outcry of Death! death!

And if my brother could but this foresee,
  The greedy poverty of Catalonia
  Straight would he flee, that it might not molest him;

For verily 'tis needful to provide,
  Through him or other, so that on his bark
  Already freighted no more freight be placed.

His nature, which from liberal covetous
  Descended, such a soldiery would need
  As should not care for hoarding in a chest.""

""Because I do believe the lofty joy
  Thy speech infuses into me, my Lord,
  Where every good thing doth begin and end

Thou seest as I see it, the more grateful
  Is it to me; and this too hold I dear,
  That gazing upon God thou dost discern it.

Glad hast thou made me; so make clear to me,
  Since speaking thou hast stirred me up to doubt,
  How from sweet seed can bitter issue forth.""

This I to him; and he to me: ""If I
  Can show to thee a truth, to what thou askest
  Thy face thou'lt hold as thou dost hold thy back.

The Good which all the realm thou art ascending
  Turns and contents, maketh its providence
  To be a power within these bodies vast;

And not alone the natures are foreseen
  Within the mind that in itself is perfect,
  But they together with their preservation.

For whatsoever thing this bow shoots forth
  Falls foreordained unto an end foreseen,
  Even as a shaft directed to its mark.

If that were not, the heaven which thou dost walk
  Would in such manner its effects produce,
  That they no longer would be arts, but ruins.

This cannot be, if the Intelligences
  That keep these stars in motion are not maimed,
  And maimed the First that has not made them perfect.

Wilt thou this truth have clearer made to thee?""
  And I: ""Not so; for 'tis impossible
  That nature tire, I see, in what is needful.""

Whence he again: ""Now say, would it be worse
  For men on earth were they not citizens?""
  ""Yes,"" I replied; ""and here I ask no reason.""

""And can they be so, if below they live not
  Diversely unto offices diverse?
  No, if your master writeth well for you.""

So came he with deductions to this point;
  Then he concluded: ""Therefore it behoves
  The roots of your effects to be diverse.

Hence one is Solon born, another Xerxes,
  Another Melchisedec, and another he
  Who, flying through the air, his son did lose.

Revolving Nature, which a signet is
  To mortal wax, doth practise well her art,
  But not one inn distinguish from another;

Thence happens it that Esau differeth
  In seed from Jacob; and Quirinus comes
  From sire so vile that he is given to Mars.

A generated nature its own way
  Would always make like its progenitors,
  If Providence divine were not triumphant.

Now that which was behind thee is before thee;
  But that thou know that I with thee am pleased,
  With a corollary will I mantle thee.

Evermore nature, if it fortune find
  Discordant to it, like each other seed
  Out of its region, maketh evil thrift;

And if the world below would fix its mind
  On the foundation which is laid by nature,
  Pursuing that, 'twould have the people good.

But you unto religion wrench aside
  Him who was born to gird him with the sword,
  And make a king of him who is for sermons;

Therefore your footsteps wander from the road.""",357992,en,en,en,

Stop When You See a Uniform,country,Buddy Brown,2019,318,{},"[Verse 1]
Stop right there when you see those boots and a uniform coming your way
Get off your cellphone, and look 'em in the eye and drop that old briefcase
If you wanna see what a hero looks like this might be your chance
Before you go back home to your safe little world, y'all don't you understand?

[Chorus]
These are the men and women that keep us living safe inside our homes
And if you took one minute your head would be spinnin' to see the things that they know
So stop what you're doing, walk up to him and tell him how much it means
That every night when you drift off to sleep
They're all across the planet making sure you're free
Stop when you see a uniform

[Verse 2]
Don't you know who you just walked past with your headphones in today?
You're all concerned with your own little world just outside the terminal gate
But they're coming home from a whole another world that we know nothing about
So the least we can give them's a standing ovation, it's time they hear us shout

[Chorus]
These are the men and women that keep us living safe inside our homes
And if you took one minute your head would be spinnin' to see the things that they know
So stop what you're doing, walk up to him and tell him how much it means
That every night when you drift off to sleep
They're all across the planet making sure you're free
Stop when you see a uniform
[Chorus]
These are the men and women that keep us living safe inside our homes
And if you took one minute your head would be spinnin' to see the things that they know
So stop what you're doing, walk up to him and tell him how much it means
That every night when you drift off to sleep
They've got it covered protecting you and me
Stop when you see a uniform

Don't want a small meal, I demand large

Those motherfuckers I am gonna charge

Came to start some beef

Look at my wrist, look it's so shiny
You wanna kill me? Come and find me
You wanna squeeze me? You're too slimy

Crawled out found a way never ran to be saved
I came out of that shit like Andy Dufresne
I was standing amazed like this is my life now
Rain pouring in darkness the lights out
The passion see it deep in my eyes now
It’s too much go sleep or go lie down
I need no fakeness around me
If you don’t know my real name we ain't family
I don’t owe a thing to a soul, you can’t stand me?
Cry me a river even bigger than the Ganges

Begging for His grace ‘cause my heart needed healing
He gave me a sign then he threw me in the deep end
And told me to break through every glass ceiling

Look I am not a saint I’m an artist I paint
Yes I am gonna change because everytime I break
I can’t remember how to put myself back together again
So here I am, my mistakes and all
With nothing in the way that would break my fall
I’ve fallen off the edge tryna chase the ball
My life’s in Your hands so just take it all

Begging for your grace ‘cause my heart needs healing
Give me a sign don’t throw me in the deep end

If tomorrow never comes I can say that today
Was a gift I received never gave away
Tried to pave the way for these youngsters
‘cause I remember what it was like being an up and comer
Being treated like you’re nothing this is coming from within
I’m so much more than the colour of my skin
Speak to me like I’m kin or treat me like I’m King
When I’m gone know that I never cheated just to win
When it’s you against the world then the world’s against you
And things don’t go how they ought or meant to
But know you can trust in your inner
Every man has a choice to become a saint or a sinner

All known albums by the fictional rapper Faygo,misc,Tango Golf Delta,2019,8,{},"100 Racks (2014)
After dropping out of college, Faygo decided to become a rapper. His first mixtape featured some of YMMV Music's rappers such as Gucci Panda (as his real name Robert Swoon, Jr.), Ned Gotti, and Eurostep.

Hustle Life, Vol. 1 (2015)
Its cover art was typical of several lesser-known rappers due to an image of a Heckler & Koch HK416 assault rifle on the cover art. It features only Ned Gotti on the song ""On The Regular"", which is produced by Zaytoven.

Run Out (2016)
It features a giant keyhole and the rapper in a Supreme hoodie looking at it. The album has two singles, ""Running From XII"" and ""I'm Like Arnold Schwarzenegger.""

The Lock Up (2016)
The rear view of a Ford Crown Victoria police car and the number 911. It is styled after a newspaper headline. Three singles were released, but they were so underrated that Faygo would already be fired from YMMV Music, and its CEO Ross Hunt would temporarily remove him from the list of artists signed to YMMV Music.

Maserati Boyz (2017)
After his life as a rapper went in jeopardy, Faygo made a collaborative album with the Memphis rapper Allmo$t There.

Hidden Hills, Pt. 1 (2019)
Released last February 22, 2019, which is important to me. It had four singles prior to its release, ""Real Rap Game"", ""Lambo Doors"", ""Skrrt Off"", and ""Rich Gang"", featuring Guapdad 4000.",4369535,en,en,en,

Got a cup full of ice and I'm 'bout to get free
Don't lecture 'bout vices, homie, you're not me
I'm not special but I know about depression
And been making music for ten years
What's your question?
Yes, it's stressful, but I'm not the esoteric type
Bo Derek with the volume 'till I'm paralyzed
Top ten? You can fuck that ven'
Never hold my breath: iron lunged leviathan
My girl would play bluegrass before my shit
But it's cool, 'cause I don't respect an ass kiss
Whatever comes up must come out
Brother Ali probably doesn't like my style
But I'm feeling his, what up to Rhymesayers
Black Paisley respects your fucking grind players
And we awkward, a little like Lee Dewyze
But those who listen closely can read between the lines

[Hook]
Got my drink in my cup so I'm ready for whatever
Gotta put my time in so I'm 'bout to pull the lever
No time like the present and I'm gonna live forever
Tired of being tired, never hear me say never
With a hand to the sky and my head in the clouds
I'm trying to get high, never wanna come down
My feet on the ground even though I feel fly
Even after take-off I'm home
[Verse 2]
I feel like music can be electric
In fact, on that, I'll bet this
My hurt and pain are second string when playing Byron Leftwich
I make this music for my people who use it
Exactly for the same reason I do, I'm still tryna get through
Like half the population
The same boat rocking, waiting
Maryland crabs inside the bucket's tryna stop the hating
The pain is thick and dense, and that just has me mocking Satan
As if I believed in anything but the ones who made me
And shaped me. Got friends, and family, and my music
And to me they equal God, so you keep your funny ruses
Amused by all the ignorance displayed in our community
Not really cool to talk about, but fuck it, that's what true to me
What's new to me?
Not much homeboy
Rode pretty hard last quarter century
Learned a few things, forgot a bunch more
Hence why I spit for the memories
No benching me
I'm A-Team here on out
So go ahead and just clear on out
And you can try to play tough
But you know you smell like
A little Lake Huron trout
I'm off of it, and back on again
Never read much Kurt Vonnegut
But I should have 'cause that would have probably
Helped me with my pondering
Like a conduit, you find promising
Communicate with no admonishment
Eye to eye, you don't need an icon
To tell you that it's time to win

Got my drink in my cup so I'm ready for whatever
Gotta put my time in so I'm 'bout to pull the lever
No time like the present and I'm gonna live forever

Naguib Mahfouz’s “Midaq Alley Chapter 12”,misc,Dr. Jessica Stock,2013,12,{},"Drawing on all her reserves of patience  and steadfastness, Umm Hussein  waited  one  day  and  then  two. She  would  stand behind the shutters of the window overlooking the cafe await­ing the young man's arrival and watch him approach with his insolent walk. Then she would see him again at midnight as he left with her hus­ band in the direction of Ghouriya Street. Blind with hatred and rage, she asked herself whether Master Radwan's advice could have been in vain.
Again she went to see the master, who shook his head  in regret and  told  her, ""Let  him  be  until 'God may accomplish  a  matter  already ordained,""' so she returned to her apartment fuming and  uttering  dire threats.  No longer  caring whether  people would gloat, she waited at the  window  until  night  came  and  the  young  man  arrived,   then wrapped  herself in her milaya and stormed  out of the apartment like a madwoman, descending  the stairs in bounds. In an instant, she was in front of the cafe. The little shops had closed and  the people of the alley had made their way to the cafe as was their nightly custom. Boss Kersha was poring, half  asleep, over the box of tokens and failed to
•notice her arrival. Her swiveling  gaze coming  to rest on  the young man, who was sipping tea from a glass in his hand,  she went over to him, passing in front  of Boss Kersha,  who didn't  raise his eyes, and struck the glass with her  hand  so that  it spilled onto  the lap of  the young man, who stood up, yelling in fright.  In a voice like thunder, she shouted at him, ""You're drinking tea, you son of  a whore?""
All eyes-those of  the people of the alley, who knew her, and of the rest of  the patrons,  who did not-fastened on the woman.  Boss Kersha looked over at her as though wakened by a bucketful of water thrown in his face and he made  to rise, but the woman shoved  him in the chest, shouting in his face, insensible with rage, ""Don't you dare move, you lecher!"" Then she turned to the youth and went on, ""What are you scared  of, my fine lad,  my litrle woman  in man's  clothing? Would you care to tell me what it is that brings you here?""
Boss Kersha stood up behind the box, too angry to speak, his face like  thunder,  but  she  shouted   at  him,  ""If  it crosses  your  mind  to defend  your little friend,  I'll smash your bones  in front of  everyone,"" and she rushed  at the young man  (who had  retreated  and  was now clinging onto Sheikh Darwish) yelling, ""You think you can destroy my horne, you miserable  little pansy?""
Quaking,the young man asked her, ""Who  are you, lady? What have I done so ...""
""Who  am  I? you don't know  who  I am? I'm your co-wife!""  said Umm Hussein, and she rained blows on him, knocking off his tarbush and giving him a bloody nose. Then  she grabbed  hold of his necktie and pulled on it hard,  choking off his voice. The astonished patrons gazed  in  amazement   at  what  was taking  place  in  front  of  them, though  in  their  hearts  they were delighted  and  greatly  amused  by the marvelously entertaining scene. Umm  Hussein's cries brought Husniya  the Baker's Wife, who came  running,  followed by her hus­ band  Giada,  his jaw slack with surprise. A moment  later, Zeita  the Cripple-maker also appeared,  but he stopped some way away, looking like a demon who'd popped up from the depths of the earth. Soon the windows of the two houses were open and heads were poking out to see what was going on. Boss Kersha, furious at seeing his boy writhe and twist as  he  attempted  in  vain  to  release  his neck from  the  strong woman's grasp, rushed toward the pair in a fury, foaming at the mouth like a buffalo bull, and seized her forearms, shouting at her, ""Let go of him,  woman.  Stop  making a scene!""
Under  her husband's weight, the woman was obliged to let go of her opponent. Her rnilaya had fallen to the floor and she was raving, her cries growing louder and louder, as she took hold of the front of Boss Kersha's gallabiya and cried, ""Beat me, would you, you lecher, and defend your little friend? Take a good look, everyone, at the lecher!""
The young man  seized the opportunity to escape and fled from the cafe at a run without a backward glance while the battle between Boss Kersha and  his wife continued,  she pulling on the front  of  his gallabiya, he trying to push  her  away and escape her grasp. In  the end, Master Radwan  el-Husseini  arose, went to them, and separated them, and the woman wrapped  herself, panting, in her milaya, and in a voice that resounded  through the cafe screamed, ""Hashish-smoker! Lunatic! Filth! Son of sixty bitches! A father of five and grandfather of twenty! Lowlife! Idiot! I spit on your black fuce!""
Boss Kersha, who was calming down, fixed her with a cruel look
and yelled at her, ""Watch your tongue, woman, and put the lid back on that cesspool you get your fllthy language from!""
""God cut off your tongue! You're the only cesspool here, you wimp,
you reprobate, you pederast!""
Waving his fist at her, he said, ""You're raving as usual. What makes you think you can get away with attacking the customers in the cafe?"" The  woman gave a terrifYing laugh and said with bitter  sarcasm, ""The  customers? Do  excuse ine! I didn't mean any harm  to the cus­
tomers, I was just attacking Boss K.ersha's personal customer!""
Master Radwan  intervened  a second  time, asking the woman  to get hold of herself and go back to her house, but, mastering  her voice with the utmost difficulty, she said, ""I will never return  to the house of that godless man so long as I live.""
Master  Radwan  insisted and Uncle Kamel  took it upon  himself to support im, telling her, in his fluting, angelic  voice,  ""Go  home, Mistress Umm  Hussein.  Go home, say, 'God  is One!'  and  heed the words of Master Radwan!""
Master  Radwan  also intervened  to stop her leaving the alley and refused to let her be until she had returned to the house, complaining bitterly. At this point, Zeita disappeared  too, and Husniya  the Baker's Wife also withdrew, followed by her  husband,  to whom  she gave a wallop on the back, telling him, ""You keep complaining about  your bad luck and saying, 'Why am I the only man in the world who gets beaten?'  Now you've seen that your  betters and  the betters  of those who bore you can get beaten too!""
The  clamor  of  batde  was succeeded  by a  heavy  quiet  as  the onlookers exchanged  mocking looks of malice and pleasure,  the hap­ piest and most gratified being Doctor Bushi. He it was who shook his head and said, in sorrowful tones, ""There is no power and no strength but in God! Dear  God, set things  to rights!""
Boss Kersha was still standing his ground-the ground on which he'd fought-and only now noticed  that  his boy had fled. Knitting his brows  obstinately,  he  made  as  though to  go  after  him,  but  Master Radwan, who was not far from him, placed  his hand  on his shoulder and  said quietly, ""Sit down,  Boss Kersha, and  get some rest.""
The  man  let out a gasp of anger and fury but retreated  sluggishly, saying  to himself  -with the  utmost  malice,  ""Harridan! Wanton! But it's my fault. I deserve worse. Anyone who sends his wife to bed with­ out a good beating is a fool,"" while Uncle  Kamel's voice rose with the cry, ""Everyone say, 'God is One'!""
Boss Kersha  threw  himself  down  on  his chair,  but  anger  seized him  once  more,  his temper rose, and  he started striking  his forehead with  his  thick,  coarse  hand  and  crying,  ''At  the  beginning I was a vicious criminal. Everyone in the quarter knew me as a blood-sucking criminal. I am a criminal. I am a bastard. I am a monster. But I deserve every humiliation because  I abandoned -wickedness of my own will."" And here he raised his head. 'just you wait, you filthy woman.  Tonight you'll  find the old Kersha, just the way he was.""
Master  Radwan,  seated   cross-legged   on   the   wooden   bench, clapped his hands  and  addressed Boss Kersha: ""Say,  'God is One!' Boss Kersha! We want  to drink  our  tea in peace.""
""We have to make peace  between  them,"" said Doctor Bushi in a whisper,  bending over  Abbas   el-Helw's   ear.  ""Between  whom  and whom?"" asked  el-Helw  wickedly. Doctor Bushi  suppressed a laugh, the sound  escaping  through his nose like the hiss of asnake, and said, ""Do  you think he'll come back to the cafe after what's  happened?""
""If  he doesn't, another will,"" said el-Helw, making a sardonic face. The   cafe  then   recovered  its  accustomed  atmosphere,  everyone went  back  to  whatever  game   or  conversation  had  occupied   them before, and the battle would have been forgotten  and left no trace, had not Boss Kersha  burst out once more, crying in a voice of thunder  like some wild beast, ""No, no! I will not submit to the will of a woman. I am a man.  I am free. I can do what I want.  Let her leave the house if she wants. Let her wander  the streets with the beggars. I am a criminal.  I am a cannibal.""

Which way would it end?

Army come, set his house on fire
Terrorized and broken, the humble hide and pray

About the place where the kingdom come
A king to walk among us
One to call our own
Finally come to make this His home

There, a baby cries
The voice of God calling to a silent world

Riding by the light of an unknown star
In the night full of heaven's hope
Hearing the news of angels
The hubmle make their way
Coming to town to look for the King

All felt is hope
To spilling over
Needs are a passing memory
Fear not worthy
Belief, a martyr's burden
Heaved upon capable shoulders
Dissuade your charge
Arrive in commonplace with the elect
Size up the furthest plateau
Inside the soul of saints

The old dog has to learn a new trick and more
Or the next trick will be on him
I've drank the oceans dry, I've stopped the time
Embraced the riddle of regret

Desire haunt me long
The light of three suns and one star
Watch over me
[Verse 2]
A square will never fit a circle (Fit a circle)
No hope, no joke, both bookends burned (Bookends burned)
I've drowned in oceans mine
I woke the dead
And still the dry bones live again (And again with me)

Desire haunt me long
The light of three suns and one star
No higher keeps us strong
The light of three suns and one star

Touch The Sky,pop,Bedemon,2006,183,{},"I'm so weary, so tired of this place
All the people so eager to join the death race
Foolish games have trapped my soul
The pains of suffering are taking their toll
Look into my eyes, catch a glimpse of Hell
But just to be free again, my soul I'd sell
I'm a prisoner of myself, my fear and my need
Just stick me with the death-needle 'cause I'll never be free
Blistering heat burns inside my head
But it'd be drowned by all the tears that I've shed
Tell me my name: let me know I'm alive
This place is so dark: I'm scared inside
I closed my eyes, let everything die
I walked through Heaven and I touched the sky
My days of Hell are soon gonna end
No more worry about you, or a job, or a friend
Life'd be so much easier if I were to die
So honey if you care, please tell me goodbye
I closed my eyes, let everything die
I walked through Heaven and I touched the sky
Someday you know you're gonna die and leave all things behind
There's days of blood and roses, buried deep within your mind
Have you thought of the newborn babies, born in this world of sorrow?
Or are you content to live life today without any worry of tomorrow
Oh lover, don't show your impartiality
You just don't know the burden of reality
Deathmaster calls, time to kiss you goodbye

Where the willows hang down
The wild birds they warble
With a low morning sound
Down in the hollow
Where the river runs cold
It was there I first listened
To the lies that you told
Now I lie on my bed
And I see your sweet face
A past I remember
Time can't erase
A letter you wrote me
They were written in shame
And know that your conscience still echoes my name

Now the nights are so lonely
Sorrow runs deep
Nothings is worse than these nights without sleep
I walk out alone and look at the sky
Too empty to sing, too lonesome to cry
Now if the ladies were blackbirds
If the ladies were thrushes
Well I'd lie there for hours
In the chilly cold marshes
And if the women were squirrels
With high bushy tails
Well I'd fill up my shotgun
With rock salt and nails
I'd fill up my shotgun

Can I get a witness I ain't talking bout the Nike thing
Lightweight I been modeling, I'm just trying it
Casting Agents think I'm fine as shit

Know a lot of things because I grew up with them Foster Kids

Remember all their faces, not for nothing, tired of being scared

Lookin through a window, thinkin' of a mission
Hear gunshots, another homeboy missin
The streets, crazy as hell but what a brother know?
A drive-by in a black 6-4
Who did it and why? Another gang cause they hate him
The person they killed, he wasn't even gangbangin
Comin' from school, mindin his own alone
But it's the homeboy's brother, so I guess it's on
16 - dead, missin' half his face
His family screams and he dream of a better place
You're either down or out
I'ma stay down and talk loud
Put on my khakis and still walk proud
It's either do do or die or get done for nuthin'
I won't run from a gun, nigga, shoot me some
I'ma die a ?full? death, it's ignorant still
But it's ill cause sometimes people have to kill
You put your flags on, Locs on, claims the ????
And get your jack on, sometimes you get blown away
You wanna live in fear but it's tragic
An innocent child in another closed casket

Been thinkin' about my future
I got to get off the streets and work it out
And face reality...

Lost in space and his brother has the only trace
Say, brethren, is you simply get a Uzi and blast?
Are you sure to get away, or does it matter to ask?

I know you feel kinda guilty cause they thought he was you
And everybody in the hood makes you wanna pursuit
The others brothers from the gang that you shot at first
And now you roll in limousines and your brother a hearse

And what a mother, because you wanna gee, she face danger
Shootin' at the house and she just a stranger to a banger

Now your brother was got, your boy, you're ready to pop
At the park you look gee'd, mad, even notorious
You carry your rag, your reputation, it embroils
Yeah, you can murder and you won't be phased
But when the death hits home to the death you a slave
Boy, your grave will take a Uzi and retaliate
Are you afraid of the fact that it might be bait?
Because I heard a lil' rumour on the L.A. streets
That tell the price on your head, can you face the G?
Your homeboys might help, but maybe they won't
Maybe they can use dollars, are you gettin the point?
Cause it's straight game and death's no joke
You better get out of the fire or you smell the smoke
It's no jokin', I became a G because I had to

Introduction English Language Arts Standards,misc,Common Core Standards Initiative,2013,90,{},"The Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts & Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects (“the Standards”) are the culmination of an extended, broad-based effort to fulfill the charge issued by the states to create the next generation of K–12 standards in order to help ensure that all students are college and career ready in literacy no later than the end of high school.

The present work, led by the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) and the National Governors Association (NGA), builds on the foundation laid by states in their decades-long work on crafting high-quality education standards. The Standards also draw on the most important international models as well as research and input from numerous sources, including state departments of education, scholars, assessment developers, professional organizations, educators from kindergarten through college, and parents, students, and other members of the public. In their design and content, refined through successive drafts and numerous rounds of feedback, the Standards represent a synthesis of the best elements of standards-related work to date and an important advance over that previous work.

As specified by CCSSO and NGA, the Standards are (1) research and evidence based, (2) aligned with college and work expectations, (3) rigorous, and (4) internationally benchmarked. A particular standard was included in the document only when the best available evidence indicated that its mastery was essential for college and career readiness in a twenty-first-century, globally competitive society. The Standards are intended to be a living work: as new and better evidence emerges, the Standards will be revised accordingly.

The Standards are an extension of a prior initiative led by CCSSO and NGA to develop College and Career Readiness (CCR) standards in reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language as well as in mathematics. The CCR Reading, Writing, and Speaking and Listening Standards, released in draft form in September 2009, serve, in revised form, as the backbone for the present document. Grade-specific K–12 standards in reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language translate the broad (and, for the earliest grades, seemingly distant) aims of the CCR standards into age- and attainment-appropriate terms.

The Standards set requirements not only for English language arts (ELA) but also for literacy in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects. Just as students must learn to read, write, speak, listen, and use language effectively in a variety of content areas, so too must the Standards specify the literacy skills and understandings required for college and career readiness in multiple disciplines. Literacy standards for grade 6 and above are predicated on teachers of ELA, history/social studies, science, and technical subjects using their content area expertise to help students meet the particular challenges of reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language in their respective fields. It is important to note that the 6–12 literacy standards in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects are not meant to replace content standards in those areas but rather to supplement them. States may incorporate these standards into their standards for those subjects or adopt them as content area literacy standards.

As a natural outgrowth of meeting the charge to define college and career readiness, the Standards also lay out a vision of what it means to be a literate person in the twenty-first century. Indeed, the skills and understandings students are expected to demonstrate have wide applicability outside the classroom or workplace. Students who meet the Standards readily undertake the close, attentive reading that is at the heart of understanding and enjoying complex works of literature. They habitually perform the critical reading necessary to pick carefully through the staggering amount of information available today in print and digitally. They actively seek the wide, deep, and thoughtful engagement with high-quality literary and informational texts that builds knowledge, enlarges experience, and broadens worldviews.

Yo
Ink blots and blocks built
Box office bunker bomb brunette, Satan fellas mock spills
I pop pills legally to wash cloths, stare at your clock still
Addiction is my dead ex, her lips the color of cold meat
After we kiss there's an odd chill
Temperature drops til my breath circles the house
Now I can rot milk
Causing a morning frost over to wash sod hills
Turning green grass to sickles of ice
Stopping this mother roses but the tops wilt from my touch
Who can lift this curse, maybe the gods will
Or not, I'm not well
I got gills and breathe through my skin like frogs on pond silt
Rain out, gray clouds on my coffee
Hands tremble from no play, all work
Tunnel vision is cone shaped
Fold space and time, no flight, gold flakes
Palm full of powder blue, pink pills control fate
I go graze and yellow blades and pastures of sulk and sadness captured
Who put your stupid feelings on a board and master
Sold to hackers, I'm that outcasted backpacker basher
Afterlife, dreamsicle tickle me with laughter
While you buck and smoking water guns getting jiggy
I back the piggy like Freud

Numb as an ice bin, you get pit roasted quickly

Unconquerable, ?? and honorable Jabberwocky constable
Unorthodox gallop gallant under flocks of Cock-a-Tzu's
I spy planets like the Hubble Telescope's real design
Don't watch the news like they want you to
I file stringed lines of dead emcees strangled
50 horses when a Scythian king dies
Rip butchery, pulling strings tight, as ratchet cords grip
Shrinking faces, spit out teeth like bullets ripping from wisped hymes
Ink line, words like calves kick human genitals to split sides
Spurt intestines out, bellies rolling back, pink eye
I was hit by the sun beam, tongues bleed from slits in it
Absorbing crystal bits, I am the lizard king
How many of you know you're really alive just a little bit
I love my skittles, drink scripts just a thimble sip
Sunshine acid vintage triple dip
I lost it already right, I think, unless you, maybe not
Or riddle this, under a cigarette smoke sprinkled mist
Past out on stage like Morrison leading a seven mile snake slithering
Slug-like in slippers on my front lawn tripping wig
Why talk about the same shit
It's for the idiots stuck in a bad trip listening
And I never gave permission for a jock to speak
On a mic stop and sleep
These new rap hackers internet, what are they laptop and beats
Overwhelmed frontal lobes with linked madness
Scrabble babble and bloggeries
These lambs kicking industrial strength attitude, not for me
I'm like Ginsberg salvaging a steel-plated moxie speech
Dipped in acid lake
Windsock breeze blowing trails set sail and pilot
My paragraph is Husky Boy section
A poster boy for failed diets
Underdark arcane radio pirate
Heart ice like Martha Pan on the forward deck
Bow hook, swing jealous steel plunges into the lower neck
Burn posters trend driven slick shape diction around fashion blab
Valley talk gangster ease idioms while cash is fad
Fanzine artist adopt one version of a geek speak bag of gas

Everything i did won’t let me go i gotta live with it

Wonder why my body infected

I need a seat there
And i ain’t tryna waste any seconds
Don’t wanna be here
Knowing it won’t change for the better
So let it be clear
If i ain’t 27 with a couple millions
Then I’m checking out that’s just my decision
It’s already made for me
I just gotta step in the position to pay for it finally have some time to kill instead of just waiting for it and end up somewhere chillin with the power to pay it forward

Are flickering towards the sky

I thought I'd rid myself of you

But I drove the damn thing right into the ground
Now my eyes are still red and my pillow is wet
I guess I'm not done crying yet
Over you
Over you
Over you

I always thought that you and I
Could do something good
It's weird to watch the flames fly
Through the neighborhood
We tried to let the fire die
And California couldn't survive it
So what chance do I have against it
I meant it, ""I'm burning for you""

I thought I'd rid myself of you

Oh in a circus show they might have let it slide
But now they give him threats
They say he'll have to die
Oh this traveling ma all he ever wanted was a bride

You steal my mind, I love the way you do me
Break it down to the sound of 'Brother Louie'
Brother Louie!
Check it out, check it out, here we go, let me say it
Tax on wax make the brothers wanna play it
To the front, to the front, to the back, to the back
To the hip,to the hop,to the rhyme,to the rap

Stays in your brain like earth, wind and fire
I take you higher, fairly you desire
I'm not a liar, I roll like a tyre!

Get out of bed and then I join in
Straight to the bathroom to wash my face
Into my surprise there's no toothpaste

Everyone wants love

Violent hash-smokers shook a chocolate machine
Involved in an eating scene

Go ahead and pop your Pringles to this one
All the anorexic chicks please remain seated for the duration of this song
You're hazardous

[Verse 1]
My insecurity's got me tugging at my shirt when the wind picks up
By the way, you gonna eat that?
I'm just a fat bastard that'd love to take the load off your plate
I'm gaining weight, but I'll blame it on metabolism
Fuck calories!
My weekly salary's enough to keep my eating habit at stand still
And my stomach's like a landfill with a never ending maximum capacity
Don't get mad at me when I pick my nose, touching food with the same finger
I'm just waiting for that obese opera singer to hit the right note
Them stuffing Zingers and Twinkies up in my bubble coat
Croak this if you wanna
I'm blazing L's with little Keebler elves that love to share their cookie creations
And they don't struggle with patience, they just keep on working happily
And when I eat all they shit, they don't get mad at me
But when I start to vomit chocolate chips, they sit and laugh at me
That's when I stomp 'em like roaches committing blasphemy
All in all, it's all in fun
All good, burger bun
With three quarter pound patties, fatty acid, and a basket fries
These wise guys at the drive-through got audacity asking me if I want my shit super sized
Ah, for now I'm like
[Hook]
Won't somebody feed me please
Before I'm forced to eat all of these MC's
On a plate, with a steak and macaroni and cheese
And a cold glass of K-double O-L Aid?
(Come on!)

[Verse 2]
So now, I'm awol from fat camp
I got caught selling Kit-Kats
This kid ratted me out for a sandwich (eat it, you little bitch!)
Now, I'm flying coach eating chicken wings
With a Tom Green Freddy Got Fingered type approach to keep the balance
And as far as I recall, I've been a glutton
With a major malfunction that cause my jaw to always gnaw something
Tell the nurse to bring the Burger King, urgently, to Room 315
And hurry up, it's an emergency
Diet's to me are kinda funny when you find yourself hungry cause health food's consuming all your money
Didn't listen when your conscience told you ""Eat the bacon!""
Now you're working treadmills till your feet are stankin'
This is for the self righteous vegans that always find something smart to say when they see my ass eating
I got cannibal traits, every animal get ate
I'll be down under with the Crocodile Hunter (G'day mate!)
We grillin alligator steaks, trading plates with Aborigines that look at us funny
Like ""Damn money, where'd you get these?""
My plate is empty, so it's like, ""Back to the States!""
To play TV dinner tag with younger hoes till my hunger grows
Then switch to a whole other dish
I'm talking like fried monkey legs [?] to asparagus cheese
Come on, really man?
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And all I eat is meat, chocolate milk, and dope beats
Fuck ripe vegetables, fresh fruit, and whole wheat
I'm from the new school, my household smells like mildew
From Chinese take-out containers for real dude
An academic underachiever, I joined the Breakfast Club and ate my way to tenth grade
And got an A in lunch, which in turn made me a firm believer
That my only true love is girls, graffiti, music, and Nestlé Crunch
Cause while other kids was in class stressing they lessons
I was back in the lunch line begging for seconds
Flirting with the cashier, remember me from last year?
(Boy your hair looks nice today, do you think I could get an extra Tootsie roll?)
Mission accomplished, Operation Hoodwinked successful
Now back to taunting fat chicks with tongue rings
And I'll tell you one thing, as long as I'm alive
I'ma live ravenous until the day God himself says it's hazardous
Kill the pacifists, and make the pu-pu platter
That consists of crying bitches dipped in boo-hoo batter
Let's pause for applause cause this kid is too much
Until my tummy's full, I ain't giving two fucks
Tell the label's they can keep they silly cash advance
Just give me an '86 Renault and a lifetime supply of food stamps

Just like a little kid, mad at the world
When I'm alone, I am defenseless
Just like the boy I was, afraid in the dark

Don't take it personally, don't be offended
Don't mind my mood changing like the weather
God knows I tried to hold it all together
Oh, I'm getting older and it ain't what I thought it would be

Wide awake, the planet spins around
A little too fast for me most of the time
Lost control, my thoughts are flickering
Just like satellites, lost in the sky

Don't take it personally, don't be offended
Don't mind my mood changing like the weather
God knows I've tried to hold it all together
I'm getting older and it ain't what I thought it would be

One day I'll find
Some peace of mind
And then I'll stop being afraid
I won't make it through the night

Lost In Violence,pop,Essence,2015,87,{},"Hellshock terror all across the front
Scared to death you run with your gun
The enemy is near as you take your aim
Shoot to kill so you don't die in vain
Cut till the day your second son's blown away
Where is your honour? where is your faith?
You've got your orders and you do what you must
Just continue forward and in freedom you must trust
Lost in violence - why am I
Lost in violence - ready to die
Forward over the graves I march without fear
The battle is on - I now see death clear
Trapped in the downfall of eternity's might
Believed in the shades of angels light
In these ruins of fallen thoughts my sleeping soul awakes
I now know what I should have done
And what I've could have changed
In my fight I've realized that I've already lost
I can only hope to get redemption by my god
Lost in violence- why am I
Lost in violence - ready to die
Run for your life
Darkness closing in
Satan screams behind
Winds of death
Destined to
Angels from above
Scarred true wings of pain
Salvation lies ahead
Grab their hands
Can't reach out
Destined to die
Will to live enforced by my strength to fight
Unlimited power to arise
I have only darkness and blood in mind
The only truth in the world is that violence guides
Light my path so I may lead the way
I will show the weak what we must change
True evil is indifference in good men
As I embrace their fears it all begins
I've searched the corners of
The world to find a reason why
But all I found was death and hate
How come I missed the light?
I stand by the deeds I've done
And prepare to live my life
My finest hour smiles at
Me as I drift into the night

Lost in violence- - ready to die",1364401,en,en,en,

Spurring me with those tears

Saving strength now, faint whispers
Come erotic communion in its splendour

Fever mirrored ghosts
Night time consolation, cross the line
Draw murder into art
Sleep inside through days

Shivering, longing for more
Insanity at its peak

Shackled within my hide
Screaming out too late
Losing to my hate
Grew together with your skin
And paced the trails of sin

Your gaze covered with virgin snow
Rigid features
It's the shallow deeds who is to blame
Deafening shrieks pierced the night

Moving into the dim lights
Hiding within a reverie

Pile high to the top of the Empire State

Ain't been this much hype since that Nas and that Hov shit
Coke spit, the fo' fifth chrome spit
Doe getter since I was small, no better than yours
Truly just check the suicide doors
Thirty inch grill and that black mink floor
Lookin back I did the shit to death
I guess I ain't killin it this rhyme I'm here to raise the dead
I'm here to raise the stakes this time it's ten mill
Supply the sink ill, ship five and then build
And I'm - Joe Crack BX finest

That the pimps and hustlers be apparent to me

Peace Sign from My Hero Academia,rock,Kuraiinu,2019,838,{},"Isn’t it odd how we always seem to call
On the memory of what we saw that day
And wonder how it flies in the sky above
A plane to follow, no reason why
Another day that passes, I cry again
Wishing upon the starry sky to empower me
Because the only thing that I seem to lack
Is all the courage to even try

So if one day, on that day
A hollow fate awaits me then
Calling out my name and carving the same
Deep inside a grave that’s set in stone...
But if right now, just right now
I can take a breath again
Everything that comes then, I’ll know that, I’ve got Strength to live on

My heart is shouting out now
“don’t you ever give up”
Louder than those who told me I would fall down
With a voice so passionately unwavering
To the you that shakes with tears
I’ll take away your sorrow
Smiling so you’ll never fear to survive
Being that hero saving everyone with a fight
So I’ll raise my hand with a peace sign
To deliver this story now

No matter how many times I want to say
“I’ll keep you safe forever” I’m not that strong
The one who needed a safe haven from the storm
I couldn’t hide away from your eyes
Even without the power to hold you close
I know you’ll be here standing right by my side
And every time I swear that I’m best alone
It is your laugh that shows my lies

When I’m feeling, lack of breathing
And I know I’ve met my end
Wondering about a life I could’ve had
Instead of this old one I threw away…..
But I know, yes I know, no one else will care about that
All the time I’m yearning, to see you—
And embrace your soul with mine!

So I’ll take my hands and face them toward the horizon
Reaching out til I can feel the light of day
Grabbing ahold of dawn and laughing all through the night
There’s no reason to hide or fear your darkened shadows
When we’re together I know we can fight on
Take my hand—away we go to travel this life!
With the present me, and always you by my side
We will make a new story now!

The days I lay awake, another scar but never dying
The moment whens I will be hurting now and hurting others
It’s only by the way you say the words you say
They always come again—The pain, right now and then
My soul in deep and heavy slumber,  Like a butterfly
Waiting to break out into life and live its only dream..
I’ll awake and take it into my hands!

My heart is shouting out now
“don’t you ever give up”
Louder than those who told me I would fall down
With a voice so passionately unwavering
To the you that shakes with tears
I’ll take away your sorrow
Smiling so you’ll never fear to survive
Being that hero saving everyone with a fight

So I’ll raise my hand with a peace sign

There was always something easier to feel so I let the clarity fall away
I can’t hold that in I know I should but I don’t

Cite all the times I’ve lost my grasp
Whatever it takes to drive my confidence lower
It makes me want to leave forever
It makes me want to call it over

Cause I’ve been told I should nеver give a first chance
Lеt alone another chance to
Anyone like you
It’s a convincing thing to retreat into

It doesn’t matter what you think or I think I need to trust myself to remember the truth
But the truth is I’m scared to sit down and talk to you (not by design but there’s no time to)

All the progress may come undone
Put aside that you and I were both once the bad ones
All the things I need to unlearn aren’t your fault
But that’s not concrete, that’s no fun
I thought you had to be a villain so I could be a hero
Or I thought I had to be a villain, I didn’t feel like a hero
I thought I’d slip through the first crack I could find now that the world’s irrevocably broken
If I wasn’t always talked down from it I would have already split it open

But nothing matters at a time like this
But what you still have and what you can salvage
I used to hope that when the worst was done
By then I would have paved my way to go and run

My judgement was clouded by what I guess
I haven’t adequately expressed
There’s no point in explaining it anymore
But it’s not like I did my best
All the things I’d ask about to change the subject to have disappeared
Til it's the two of us sitting in the kitchen knowing we're not supposed to be here

Nobody's the enemy
I’ll push you incrementally
I'm all read up on everything
I studied all the chemistry
I won't test you on anything
I should be the last thing on your mind

Out of energy and out of ideas
You don’t need another on your list of fears
And no one’s superhuman anymore
Blown over by the smallest war
I know for sure now I am not a burden but I always knew I was a lot of work
I thought I could do this forever but then I wonder why I keep getting hurt

I'm a young southern money making over-achiever
Make another cash deposit give the teller a seizure
So many cars I forgot like I got Chamnesia
Big paper yea I'm hearing them talking
But I ain't believing that because I'm hearing this often
Doo-doo-doo
This number you're calling
Has been disconnected cause the sucker ain't balling
I say what's on my mind, they act like its a crime
So get my lawyer on the line, I'll be doing some time
They're trying to bring me down, tell em they can keep trying
I need that Oprah Winfrey money you know I'm gon' get mine
On the grind I'm getting my green like a vegetarian
When we done, send them to the cemetery
Keep thinking I'ma lose, I ain't ever worried
I'll probably fall off the 15th of never worried

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]
I've been a lot of places, seen a lot of faces
Caught a lot of cases, and beat most of them
I came in the back door and left through the front
Shining, glistening, smoking a blunt
Beef, hmm, speak and I'ma end it
Walk by the dance floor winking at the women
Gang of bitches sagging my pants
Baby girl on my dick, Why you grabbing my hand?
You almost grabbed the magnum P-I
Sorry baby-boo I'm on my mission about my B-I
Nah - I can't mess with that
Besides, I got a motherfucking jet to catch
I'm trying to be the first rap billionaire
As I, pull on an ounce with my nephew Chamillionaire
It's so easy to see- it's like McGrady and Kobe, pay me you owe me
Top dollar with the gold flea collar
Dipping in my blue Impala
Up and down the block
Non-stop I'm a hard pill to swallow, tough act to follow
Its the dogg-father nigga holla

On an island with bitch that just love to listen to Soca
Do different shit my money, I buy horses
Invest in a couple resorts and a couple golf courses
Before you go against me, I think you need to be cautious
Cause I got a lot of money and got a lot of resources

Matter fact
Imma end it all in detail
Cause I was focused on my music
I ain’t need tail
But all it ever did
Was put me in a deep hell
Like oh my
God damn Millez

Was a a girl

You was out here saving hoes
Like they Louis lane
Now you out here chasing cats
Like you Bruce Wayne
Oh my this a side
That they ain’t never seen
Looking up to god
Hoping I can live the way I dream
Remember writing songs on the bus
When I was seventeen
Now I’m hitting hoes in the crib
Like I was Charlie sheen
Now I’m getting paid
For the things
That you wanna do
Made yo hoe vanished
Gave her back like it
Was peekaboo
Said you wanna hustle
For this life
But you ain’t making moves
Boy I’m on the grind
And my team gine be with me too
Boy I really made it
Out my mommas basement
Telling bobby If he send it
Then I’m gonna take
I been working all year
I know my shawty hate it
But this is what you gotta do
If you wanna chase it
But I was was meant to get bag
And give it to moms
Now I wanna reach my goal

To forget about all this hurt and pain?
When you kissed me I knew it would be no more
It's not too late to erase all our past mistakes but this space
That's between us now, it surrounds us now
It can be filled right out if we try
All the times we've tried to take all of the things
That turned this hate sour and cold, did you ever even think we had a chance?
All the times we've tried to make amends to the life
We built through this rose-tinted lens, did you ever think we had a chance?
What do you think?
Running far away from these feelings is all we can do
If we want to live a lie and live our lives in shadows that aren't there
Why do we constantly run ourselves into the ground
With these apathetic attitudes towards all we can achieve with perseverance
Hard work and a willingness to share our joy?

I felt so relaxed, so cool
What killed another fool
Just kept me sustained

So I'll just watch the mountains grow
Listen to the wind lie to me
Diggin' them changes on the radio
I'm cravin' some cool, cool water
I'm dying of thirst
Like some fool salted my circumcision

And the yogi's so high
But the difference is little differences
I've never been so high
Only difference is little differences
I'm stoned, stone cold
Stoned, I'm stoned
I swear, I'm there
I'm stoned, uh

First the silence, then the heat
Then fear sets in
Afraid you're gonna get an answer you don't want to hear
The truth puts blisters on my skin

Now, I got a problem with this whole concept, you see
Ain't no beginning, no end
It seems like every time I think I've arrived
A whole new trip begins

And the difference is
Should I say, the problem is, oh

I've never been so high
Only difference is little differences
And the yogi's so high
But the difference is little differences

I'm stoned, stone cold
Stoned, I'm stoned
Stone cold, I swear
I'm stoned, cold
Stoned
I'm there
I swear, I'm there
I'm stoned, cold
Stoned, so stoned

The First Book Of Nephi His Reign And Ministry Chap. 1.5,misc,"Joseph Smith, Jr.",1830,9,"{""Joseph Smith / Jr.""}","1 Nephi 5:1
And it came to pass that after we had come down into the
wilderness unto our father, behold, he was filled with joy, and
also my mother, Sariah, was exceedingly glad, for she truly had
mourned because of us.

1 Nephi 5:2
For she had supposed that we had perished in the wilderness;
and she also had complained against my father, telling him that
he was a visionary man; saying: Behold thou hast led us forth
from the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we
perish in the wilderness.

1 Nephi 5:3
And after this manner of language had my mother complained
against my father.

1 Nephi 5:4
And it had come to pass that my father spake unto her, saying:
I know that I am a visionary man; for if I had not seen the
things of God in a vision I should not have known the goodness of
God, but had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished with my
brethren.
1 Nephi 5:5
But behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which
things I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver
my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto
us in the wilderness.

1 Nephi 5:6
And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, comfort
my mother, Sariah, concerning us, while we journeyed in the
wilderness up to the land of Jerusalem, to obtain the record of
the Jews.

1 Nephi 5:7
And when we had returned to the tent of my father, behold
their joy was full, and my mother was comforted.

1 Nephi 5:8
And she spake, saying: Now I know of a surety that the Lord
hath commanded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I
also know of a surety that the Lord hath protected my sons, and
delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and given them power
whereby they could accomplish the thing which the Lord hath
commanded them. And after this manner of language did she speak.

1 Nephi 5:9
And it came to pass that they did rejoice exceedingly, and did
offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto the Lord; and they gave
thanks unto the God of Israel.
1 Nephi 5:10
And after they had given thanks unto the God of Israel, my
father, Lehi, took the records which were engraven upon the
plates of brass, and he did search them from the beginning.

1 Nephi 5:11
And he beheld that they did contain the five books of Moses,
which gave an account of the creation of the world, and also of
Adam and Eve, who were our first parents;

1 Nephi 5:12
And also a record of the Jews from the beginning, even down
to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah;

1 Nephi 5:13
And also the prophecies of the holy prophets, from the
beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of
Zedekiah; and also many prophecies which have been spoken by the
mouth of Jeremiah.

1 Nephi 5:14
And it came to pass that my father, Lehi, also found upon the
plates of brass a genealogy of his fathers; wherefore he knew
that he was a descendant of Joseph; yea, even that Joseph who was
the son of Jacob, who was sold into Egypt, and who was preserved
by the hand of the Lord, that he might preserve his father,
Jacob, and all his household from perishing with famine.
1 Nephi 5:15
And they were also led out of captivity and out of the land
of Egypt, by that same God who had preserved them.

1 Nephi 5:16
And thus my father, Lehi, did discover the genealogy of his
fathers. And Laban also was a descendant of Joseph, wherefore he
and his fathers had kept the records.

1 Nephi 5:17
And now when my father saw all these things, he was filled
with the Spirit, and began to prophesy concerning his seed—

1 Nephi 5:18
That these plates of brass should go forth unto all nations,
kindreds, tongues, and people who were of his seed.

1 Nephi 5:19
Wherefore, he said that these plates of brass should never
perish; neither should they be dimmed any more by time. And he
prophesied many things concerning his seed.

1 Nephi 5:20
And it came to pass that thus far I and my father had kept
the commandments wherewith the Lord had commanded us.

1 Nephi 5:21
And we had obtained the records which the Lord had commanded
us, and searched them and found that they were desirable; yea,
even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the
commandments of the Lord unto our children.

1 Nephi 5:22
Wherefore, it was wisdom in the Lord that we should carry
them with us, as we journeyed in the wilderness towards the land
of promise.",168388,en,en,en,
The Bomb Circle,misc,Ben Frost,2016,71,"{""Mariam Wallentin"",""Lieselot De Wilde"",""Jördis Richter"",""Reykjavík Sinfonía""}","My brother Paul was five when I killed him. It wasn't that I bore him any ill will, I just knew he couldn't stay. I would never be free of the dog until he was gone.

Paul and I had gone for a walk along the sand, the morning after a ferocious storm, and the beach had been transformed by massive movements of sand and rock. In fact, the sand had all but disappeared. Paul was happily holding me by the hand, and asking why the birds didn't get blown away in the storm, and why the sea didn't fill up with so much water coming down.

Suddenly we came upon a large, rusted piece of metal, sticking up out of the sand. I touched the side of the tapered cylinder wonderingly, feeling something very calm and strong about it. Then I stepped back and looked at it again. It was a bomb, stood on its tail.

I went back to it carefully, stroking it gently, making shushing noises with my mouth. It was rust-red and black, with its rotund decay, smelling dank and casting a shellshadow. I found myself looking at Paul, slapping the water with this great flat piece of wood, almost as big as he was. I smiled.

[Frank & Paul]
""See this? This is a bell.""
""Wha's a bell?""
""That noise we hear on Sunday.""
""After breakfast?""
""That's right, that's what this is.""
""A breakfast?""
""No, a bell.""
""B is for Bell.""
""I know what we'll do. I'll go up on the dunes, and you'll hit the bell with your piece of wood, and I'll see if I can hear it. Shall we do that? It might be very loud. Will you be frightened?""
""No, not frightened.""
""Wait. Don't hit it yet. Wait 'til I'm far away. It might have only one ring in it, and we don't want to waste it.""
""Alright, but can I hit it really, really hard?""
""Wait 'til I wave from the dune.""
""Can I practise?""
""Practise hitting the water. Wait 'til I get to the dune.""
""Promise.""
Paul was a distant puppet, jerking and leaping and whacking the bomb repeatedly on the side.
""Shit, I forgot to tell him where to hit it.""

...That's what a five-hundred kilo German bomb does.

The tips of some of these splinters of igneous rock still stick out above the sand, forming the Bomb Circle, poor dead Paul's most fitting monument: a blasphemous stone circle where the shadows play.",2975832,en,en,en,

Hooked,rap,Sheldon Elvin,2014,33,{},"{Verse 1}

It was just a normal day
I remember it vividly
I went to make some money with my friend for a stick of weed
We went to the city and checked the vicinity
Then entered familiar shops not letting the piggies see
Decked us some shit and fee before they could know
We always use to aim for some Nautica clothes or some cologne
We sold it to some local grafers and scored us some dope
And then wеnt for a feed and a drink I think I ordered a boat?
I wasn't asked for id whеn I formally approached
When buying booze I would just pretend to talk on the phone
With car keys in my hand in that sort of a pose
Rich people do when they think they're more important then most
We walked to the close traino and left
Back to interlude
To drink some goon and blaze up a sesh
Then maybe later try to gather up some ladies for sex
Placing a bet that this day will be the same as the next
{Chorus 1}

I was hooked
On the weed and the women
I was hooked
On the thieving and fibbing
I was hooked
At 13 I was living on the streets and I didn't want to leave for a minute I was hooked
On the things that were pimping
I was hooked
I believed it was wicked
And I looked
Now I see that it isn't so I speak what I written to a beat in a rhythm and I'm
HOOKED

{Verse 2}

It was just a normal night
In a room that's full of graffiti letters
I'm with this chick and she's beautiful but extremely preggers
Indeed pathetic
But suitable I proceed with effort
I seem to recon that she's rootable and she's keen to get it
We sleep together inside this abandoned house
It's somewhere in northbridge
Right where you dance about
I feel her soft tongue collided with my rancid mouth
And I can hear a band play as I'm sliding her panties down
Tonight I'm just glad it's loud
Cos' in the next room my ex is fucking
This 20 something year old and being extra stubborn
I bet she's puffing meth I fucking said its best she doesn't
Still she wouldn't listen cos' she's pimping to impress the others
I bet she suffers when she's older and wiser
With her revolting saliva
Crying while holding a liter
And this preggers bitch
She is just a ? vagina so I rolled to the side
It would be a lie if I told her I liked her
{Chorus 2}

I was hooked
On the weed and the women
I was hooked
On the thieving and fibbing
I was hooked
At 13 I was living on the streets and I didn't want to leave for a minute I was hooked
On the things that were pimping
I was hooked
I believed it was wicked
And I looked
Now I see that it isn't so I speak what I written to a beat in a rhythm and I'm
HOOKED

{Verse 3}

It was just a normal evening
I was pissy with crew
We went to Jack Hanna lake to see some chicks that we knew
Who had ciggies and booze with them and their titties were huge Little did we know they were with some insidious idiots too
Familiar dudes known to be some cunts that are dangerous
One of them started chocking me and punching my face in
I was just thinking hopefully my brothers have stayed with
But they didn't
Only fricking one of my mates did
I didn't blame them ? if you must
I understand these fuckers are much older then us
I take like one swing now this cunts holding his gut
Saying I hit his broken rib just sulking and stuff
Some sluts told me to run but I stick with my mate
These two guys drop me then start kicking my face
A fricking shoe chips my tooth now I'm injured and gray
Still I flirt with their missuses as I'm limping away
{Chorus 3}

I was hooked
On the weed and the women
I was hooked
On the thieving and fibbing
I was hooked

No matter what
You don't want to get hooked like me
If you're in it then you should try leave
